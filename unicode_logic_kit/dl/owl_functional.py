"""A parser/renderer for the **OWL 2 Functional-Style Syntax**, restricted to ALCHQ.

`OWL 2 Functional-Style Syntax <https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Functional-Style_Syntax>`_
is the W3C-standardised, S-expression-shaped ``Keyword(arg arg ...)`` concrete
syntax for a whole OWL 2 *ontology document* — Declarations, an ``Ontology(...)``
wrapper, and a flat list of axioms — as opposed to
:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.owl_manchester`'s frame-based, keyword-infix Manchester
Syntax, which this module otherwise mirrors closely: same recursive-descent
style, same "refuse loudly, name the construct" convention, and the same
treatment of prefixed/full-IRI names as opaque :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.concepts.Atomic`/
role/individual strings, with no RDF-graph or IRI-resolution machinery. This is
the *OWL bridge, part 2*: it reads/writes exactly the ALCHQ-expressible fragment
of a Functional-Style ontology document into/from :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.tableau.TBox`/
:class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.tableau.ABox`, plus a standalone class-expression
entry point analogous to :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.owl_manchester.parse_manchester`.

Supported fragment (ALCHQ — this kit's DL fragment, see
:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.tableau`'s module docstring for the RBox/counting
machinery this reduces to):

    - **Document shell**: zero or more ``Prefix(pfx:=<iri>)`` lines (parsed and
      discarded — see "IRIs and names" below), then one
      ``Ontology(<iri>? <version-iri>? axiom*)`` wrapper (both IRIs optional and,
      like the prefixes, discarded: this module carries no ontology-metadata
      state, only the TBox/ABox content);
    - **Class expressions**: ``owl:Thing``/``owl:Nothing`` (⊤/⊥, either the
      abbreviated spelling or the resolved full IRI —
      ``<http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing>``/``...#Nothing``);
      ``ObjectIntersectionOf(CE CE+)``, ``ObjectUnionOf(CE CE+)`` (n-ary,
      folding **left** into the binary :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.concepts.And`/
      :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.concepts.Or` AST, matching
      :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.owl_manchester`'s documented left-fold for
      ``and``/``or`` chains); ``ObjectComplementOf(CE)``;
      ``ObjectSomeValuesFrom(OPE CE)``, ``ObjectAllValuesFrom(OPE CE)``,
      ``ObjectHasValue(OPE a)`` (a value restriction ->
      :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.concepts.HasValue`, a concept kind of its own
      and NOT ``ObjectSomeValuesFrom(OPE ObjectOneOf(a))``, which stays
      refused -- see that class's docstring);
      ``ObjectMinCardinality(n OPE CE?)``, ``ObjectMaxCardinality(n OPE CE?)``,
      ``ObjectExactCardinality(n OPE CE?)`` (the qualifying class-expression
      argument is OPTIONAL per the W3C grammar's ``'(' n ObjectPropertyExpression
      ClassExpression? ')'`` production, defaulting to ``owl:Thing`` when
      omitted — both the 2-arg "unqualified" and 3-arg "qualified" spellings are
      accepted on read; see "Qualified number restrictions" below); atomic names
      (IRI or prefixed name, taken verbatim — see "IRIs and names").
    - **Axioms**: ``SubClassOf(CE CE)`` -> ``TBox.add``; ``EquivalentClasses(CE
      CE+)`` -> a chain of pairwise ``TBox.add_equivalence`` calls (sound: OWL's
      n-ary ``EquivalentClasses`` is defined as pairwise equivalence — see
      "EquivalentClasses and DisjointClasses" below); ``DisjointClasses(CE CE+)``
      -> reduced to one ``SubClassOf(ObjectIntersectionOf(Ci Cj) owl:Nothing)``
      per unordered pair, since ALCHQ has no primitive "disjoint" TBox axiom
      (see the same section); ``SubObjectPropertyOf(OPE OPE)`` ->
      ``TBox.add_role_inclusion``; ``TransitiveObjectProperty(OPE)`` ->
      ``TBox.add_transitive_role``; ``ObjectPropertyDomain(OPE CE)`` /
      ``ObjectPropertyRange(OPE CE)`` -> ``TBox.add_role_domain`` /
      ``TBox.add_role_range`` (stored NATIVELY in the role box, not desugared
      into the equivalent GCI -- see ``TBox.add_role_domain``);
      ``SameIndividual(a1 a2+)`` -> a CONSECUTIVE chain of
      ``ABox.assert_same`` calls (sound because equality is transitive, so the
      chain entails every pair -- the same argument ``EquivalentClasses`` uses,
      and deliberately NOT ``DifferentIndividuals``' all-pairs expansion);
      ``NegativeObjectPropertyAssertion(OPE a b)`` ->
      ``ABox.assert_negative_role``; ``ClassAssertion(CE a)`` ->
      ``ABox.assert_concept``; ``ObjectPropertyAssertion(OPE a b)`` ->
      ``ABox.assert_role``; the DATA layer -- ``DataSomeValuesFrom(DPE DR)``,
      ``DataAllValuesFrom(DPE DR)``, ``DataHasValue(DPE lt)``,
      ``DataMin/Max/ExactCardinality(n DPE DR?)`` as class expressions (the exact
      form desugared to ``DataAtLeast ⊓ DataAtMost``), the data ranges
      ``DataIntersectionOf``/``DataUnionOf``/``DataComplementOf``/``DataOneOf``/
      ``DatatypeRestriction`` with typed literals (``"400"^^xsd:integer``,
      ``"abc"``, ``"abc"@en``), and ``SubDataPropertyOf``,
      ``EquivalentDataProperties``, ``DisjointDataProperties``,
      ``FunctionalDataProperty``, ``DataPropertyDomain``, ``DataPropertyRange``,
      ``DatatypeDefinition``, ``DataPropertyAssertion`` and
      ``NegativeDataPropertyAssertion`` (see "The data layer" below);
      ``DifferentIndividuals(a1 a2+)`` -> **every**
      pairwise ``ABox.assert_distinct`` (all C(k, 2) pairs, not just a
      consecutive chain — see "DifferentIndividuals" below, this is a
      completeness requirement, not a style choice); ``Declaration(Class(...)
      / ObjectProperty(...) / NamedIndividual(...))`` parsed and discarded
      (declarations carry no ALCHQ-relevant content, since
      :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.concepts`'s ``Atomic``/role/individual names are
      already untyped strings — this is not a silent weakening, just a no-op
      the W3C spec itself defines as non-restrictive); axiom-level and
      standalone ``Annotation(...)``/``AnnotationAssertion(...)`` parsed and
      discarded (annotations are explicitly non-logical in OWL 2, so dropping
      them is not a "weaker than requested" translation of truth-bearing
      content) — an axiom's own leading ``axiomAnnotations`` (e.g.
      ``SubClassOf(Annotation(rdfs:label "x") A B)``) are skipped the same way,
      before its real arguments are parsed.

Rejected loudly, one :class:`OwlFunctionalUnsupportedError` per construct,
naming it by its OWL keyword (mirrors
:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.owl_manchester`'s messages):
``ObjectInverseOf`` (inverse roles — ALCHQ has none; the ONE place it is read is
either side of a ``SubObjectPropertyOf``, where ``r ⊑ s⁻`` is a genuinely
different axiom from ``r ⊑ s`` that a ``TBox`` holds, ``rbox_to_fol`` renders and
the tableau then refuses BY NAME at query time), ``ObjectHasSelf``, ``ObjectOneOf`` (nominals), ``HasKey``, ``DisjointUnion``,
an OWL 2 BUILT-IN property name in any non-tautological position, anonymous
individuals (``_:nodeID``), and inside the data layer an out-of-scope facet
(``xsd:pattern``, the length facets, an ordering facet on a non-numeric base)
or an ill-typed literal -- each by name, from
:class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.datatypes.UnsupportedDatatypeError`. Also refused, by
name and with the wording :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.owl_manchester` uses: a
BUILT-IN datatype name (``xsd:integer``, either namespace spelling) where a CLASS
is wanted, and ``owl:Thing``/``owl:Nothing`` where a DATA RANGE is wanted --
OWL 2 does not let one name be both a class and a datatype -- and a literal with
no first-order term (``xsd:float``/``xsd:double``, a decimal no ``Number`` holds
exactly), so that an axiom this reader ACCEPTS is one the FOL image can render.

CONSUMED without logical content (not refused: nothing is lost) -- reported by
:func:`parse_owl_functional_axioms` in ``OwlFunctionalResult.consumed``, one
:class:`ConsumedAxiom` each: ``SubAnnotationPropertyOf``,
``AnnotationPropertyDomain`` and ``AnnotationPropertyRange`` (annotation
properties carry no content under the OWL 2 direct semantics, so these are
exactly what ``AnnotationAssertion`` already was), and a TAUTOLOGICAL property
inclusion into ``owl:topObjectProperty``/``owl:topDataProperty`` or out of
``owl:bottomObjectProperty``/``owl:bottomDataProperty``.

The data layer
---------------
The data half of OWL 2 -- see :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.datatypes` -- is stored
(``TBox.add_data_property_*``, ``ABox.assert_data``) and translated by the FOL
image, and REFUSED by the in-house tableau, which has no data domain. A parser
never refuses an axiom KIND, so all of it is read here. The reading of a
literal is OWL's own: ``"lexical"^^datatype`` (a full-IRI datatype is
canonicalised, so ``<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer>`` and
``xsd:integer`` are one datatype), a plain ``"text"`` is an ``xsd:string``, and
``"text"@en`` a language-tagged string. A BARE numeral such as ``42`` is not a
literal in this syntax (it is in Manchester Syntax) and is a syntax error.

A whole ontology, with the refusals as data
--------------------------------------------
:func:`parse_owl_functional` is STRICT: it raises on the FIRST construct
outside the fragment, so a real ontology carrying one ``DataPropertyRange``
yields no TBox at all. :func:`parse_owl_functional_axioms` is the per-axiom
reader — one tokenization, one pass, recovering at AXIOM boundaries — and
returns an :class:`OwlFunctionalResult` holding the TBox/ABox it could build
plus one :class:`RefusedAxiom` per axiom it could not, each naming the
construct, its offset and its own source text. It recovers from
:class:`OwlFunctionalUnsupportedError` and from NOTHING else: malformed input
still raises, because recovering from an unbalanced paren could drop arbitrary
content. See that function for the contract.

IRIs and names
---------------
Exactly :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.owl_manchester`'s convention (both readers store
one IRI as ONE Python string, the IRI WITHOUT its angle brackets, in every
position), adapted to two
concrete-syntax spellings instead of one: a **full IRI** token, ``<...>``, is
stored as the kit name with the angle brackets stripped (``<http://example.org/Person>``
-> ``Atomic("http://example.org/Person")``); a **prefixed (or otherwise bare)
name** token, e.g. ``ex:Person`` or a plain ``Person``, is stored VERBATIM, with
no prefix resolution at all — this module carries no ``Prefix(...)`` -> IRI
table, since (like Manchester's ``owl:Thing``/``owl:Nothing`` special case) the
kit's ``Atomic``/role/individual names are opaque strings, not resolved IRIs.
Rendering back (:func:`to_owl_functional_class_expression`, :func:`to_owl_functional`)
picks one of the two spellings DETERMINISTICALLY, by a single rule: a name
containing ``"://"`` (i.e., shaped like an absolute IRI with a network scheme) is
wrapped back in ``<...>``; every other name is written bare when the tokenizer
reads it as ONE plain word, and in ``<...>`` otherwise. The brackets are the
syntax's own escape and carry ANY name that has no ``>`` in it — whitespace, the
structural characters ``()=<>"``, the empty name, a name spelled like a keyword
the reader dispatches on (``ObjectUnionOf``, ``Annotation``, ...) and an
anonymous-individual label (``_:x``) alike — because the reader takes everything
up to the first ``>`` for one name. So
``parse_owl_functional_class_expression(to_owl_functional_class_expression(c))
== c`` holds for every concept ``c`` built from any name string that has a spelling
(see "Round-trip guarantee" below); the RENDERED spelling need not match the
ORIGINALLY PARSED spelling (a full-IRI ``owl:Thing`` reads as
:class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.concepts.Top` and always renders back as the bare
``"owl:Thing"``, for instance), only the resulting
:class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.concepts.Concept`/``TBox``/``ABox`` structure must
match, which is exactly the oracle the tests check.

A name with NO spelling is refused, by name, with a :class:`ValueError`: a name
holding ``>`` (which ends a full IRI, and a bare ``>`` is no part of a word); a
name that ALREADY carries its brackets (a hand-built ``"<http://x.org/A>"``),
since ``<...>`` reads back as the text between the brackets, which is another
name, and ``<<...>>`` is refused by the reader; and ``owl:Thing`` /
``owl:Nothing`` (in either spelling) as a CLASS, which the reader makes the top
and the bottom class however they are written (as a role or an individual they
are ordinary names). The same rule, over a different escape, is
:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.owl_manchester`'s "Names with no spelling".

EquivalentClasses and DisjointClasses
---------------------------------------
Neither is a primitive of :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.tableau.TBox` (which only
has ``add`` (⊑) and ``add_equivalence`` (⊑ both ways) — see its module
docstring), so both n-ary OWL axioms are DECOMPOSED at parse time:
``EquivalentClasses(C1 C2 ... Ck)`` becomes the chain ``add_equivalence(C1, C2)``,
``add_equivalence(C2, C3)``, ..., ``add_equivalence(C{k-1}, Ck)`` — sound
because pairwise-consecutive equivalence already entails the full mutual
equivalence of every pair by transitivity of ⊑, and it is what
:func:`to_owl_functional` can deterministically detect and re-fold on the way
out (see below). ``DisjointClasses(C1 ... Ck)`` becomes one
``add(C_i ⊓ C_j, ⊥)`` GCI per UNORDERED pair ``i < j`` (all C(k, 2) of them,
not a chain — disjointness has no transitive shortcut the way equivalence
does: knowing C1⊓C2⊑⊥ and C2⊓C3⊑⊥ says nothing about C1⊓C3), which is exactly
what "``DisjointClasses`` pairwise" means model-theoretically and is always
expressible in ALCHQ (conjunction and ⊥ are both primitive), hence
unconditionally reducible — there is no case where this module rejects
``DisjointClasses`` outright, unlike the several other axiom kinds it does
reject by name. :func:`to_owl_functional` does not attempt to re-detect and
re-fold a set of GCIs back into a single ``DisjointClasses(...)`` axiom (that
would require solving a covering problem over ``TBox.inclusions`` with no
guarantee of a unique answer) — it always renders each ``TBox.inclusions``
entry as its own axiom, using the ``EquivalentClasses`` re-fold ONLY where the
adjacent-pair shape ``add_equivalence`` itself produces is recognised (see
:func:`_render_axioms`); every other inclusion, including one that
happens to look like ``C ⊓ D ⊑ ⊥``, is rendered as a plain ``SubClassOf``.
This asymmetry (read supports both compact forms, write only re-folds one)
is deliberate and harmless: :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.tableau.TBox` equality
(a plain ``@dataclass``) only ever compares the underlying ``inclusions``
list, never which OWL keyword produced it, so the round-trip oracle
``parse_owl_functional(to_owl_functional(tbox, abox)) == (tbox, abox)`` holds
regardless of which axiom spelling is chosen on the way out.

DifferentIndividuals
----------------------
:class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.tableau.ABox` has no unique name assumption (see
"Qualified number restrictions" in :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.tableau`'s module
docstring), so ``a ≠ b`` is a genuine semantic fact that must be asserted, not
inferred from two individuals merely having different names. OWL's
``DifferentIndividuals(a1 ... ak)`` asserts ALL of them pairwise distinct, so
reading it as anything less than every one of the C(k, 2) pairs — e.g. only a
consecutive chain, the way ``EquivalentClasses`` is decomposed above — would
be a silent WEAKENING of what the axiom actually states (equivalence has a
free transitive closure through ⊑; distinctness has no such closure: knowing
``a ≠ b`` and ``b ≠ c`` says nothing about whether ``a`` and ``c`` might still
be forced equal), which the kit's honesty convention forbids. So every pair is
asserted explicitly. :func:`to_owl_functional`, symmetrically, does not try to
re-cluster ``ABox.distinct_assertions`` back into one k-ary
``DifferentIndividuals(...)`` per clique (an unnecessary complication — see
the DisjointClasses note above for the identical reasoning): it renders each
``distinct_assertions`` entry as its own binary ``DifferentIndividuals(a b)``,
which is itself perfectly legal OWL 2 syntax (the W3C grammar's minimum arity
is two, not three) and round-trips to the identical single pair.

``SameIndividual(a1 ... ak)`` is the CONTRAST that makes the argument above
concrete: equality IS transitive, so the consecutive chain ``a1 = a2``,
``a2 = a3``, … already entails every pair, and reading it that way is not a
weakening. Its renderer is the same one-binary-line-per-pair shape, for the
same reason.

Qualified number restrictions
------------------------------
Identical semantics to :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.owl_manchester`'s ``min``/
``max``/``exactly``: ``ObjectMinCardinality``/``ObjectMaxCardinality`` parse
into :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.concepts.AtLeast`/:class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.concepts.AtMost`,
and ``ObjectExactCardinality(n OPE CE?)`` desugars AT PARSE TIME into
``AtLeast(n, role, CE) ⊓ AtMost(n, role, CE)`` (there is no separate "exactly"
AST node — see :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.concepts`). Unlike
:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.owl_manchester.to_manchester` (which omits the
qualifying-class text when it is ⊤, for terseness),
:func:`to_owl_functional_class_expression` always renders the explicit 3-arg
qualified form — S-expression syntax has no terseness pressure the way
Manchester's inline keyword notation does, and always emitting one shape
keeps the renderer simpler with no loss of round-trip fidelity (the 2-arg
unqualified form is still accepted on READ, defaulting to ``owl:Thing``,
exactly like Manchester's bare ``role min n``). See ``dl.tableau``'s
"Qualified number restrictions" section for the reasoning side, in particular
the SIMPLE ROLES restriction (a number restriction on a transitive role, or
one with a transitive sub-role, is rejected there — by
:class:`~unicode_logic_kit.dl.tableau.NonSimpleRoleError` — not by this module,
which only builds the AST).

No ambiguity, no precedence
-----------------------------
Unlike :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.dl.owl_manchester` (whose ``_PREC`` lattice and
``_paren`` helper resolve a genuinely ambiguous infix grammar), OWL 2
Functional-Style Syntax has NO precedence to resolve: every compound
expression is ``Keyword(arg arg ...)``, fully parenthesised by the keyword
itself. :func:`_render_ce` therefore needs no precedence table and never
omits or inserts a parenthesis conditionally — the keyword IS the
parenthesisation.

Round-trip guarantee
---------------------
``parse_owl_functional_class_expression(to_owl_functional_class_expression(c))
== c`` for every ALCHQ concept ``c``, and
``parse_owl_functional(to_owl_functional(tbox, abox)) == (tbox, abox)`` for
every ALCHQ ``(tbox, abox)`` pair — see ``tests/test_owl_functional.py`` for
the hand-checked cases, including one per constructor, nested expressions, and
a full document with every supported axiom kind.

The one exception is a knowledge base the READER refuses on principle: a
hand-built ``Atomic`` named like a built-in datatype (``xsd:integer`` is a
datatype, never a class), a datatype named ``owl:Thing``/``owl:Nothing``, or a
literal with no first-order term (``xsd:float``/``xsd:double``, a decimal no
``Number`` holds exactly). :func:`to_owl_functional` writes such a knowledge base
as it was given, and :func:`parse_owl_functional` refuses the text by name on the
way back in — loudly, never as a different knowledge base.

    The entry point for a real ontology. :func:`parse_owl_functional` raises as

    ``DataPropertyRange`` yields nothing at all; this returns everything it

    the construct, its offset and its own source text. House rule: an
    unsupported fragment is refused LOUDLY, by name — never approximated and
    never silently dropped — so the refusals are part of the RESULT, and a
    caller who ignores them is choosing to, in writing.

    One tokenization and ONE pass over the document, recovering at axiom
    boundaries. Each axiom is parsed into a scratch ``TBox``/``ABox`` and
    merged only on success, so a refused axiom leaves nothing behind
    structurally rather than by anyone's reading of the parser.

        ``dl.abox_consistent(doc.tbox and doc.abox)`` is the in-house tableau
        over the SAME object, and the two must agree.

    Raises:
        OwlFunctionalSyntaxError: on MALFORMED input only — an unterminated
            IRI or string literal, an unbalanced paren, a missing
            ``Ontology(``, a bad name, trailing input. Those are questions
            about the document rather than about the fragment, and recovering

            :class:`OwlFunctionalUnsupportedError`: that class is precisely
            what this function recovers from, and it is a SUBCLASS, so a
            caller catching ``OwlFunctionalSyntaxError`` around this call is
            catching malformed input alone.
        RecursionError: a class expression nested about a thousand levels deep
            (Python's default recursion limit). The reader is recursive descent
            and the recursion is not rewritten; the call fails, it never
            truncates. Nothing short of a machine-generated document nests that
            deeply.

    ``accepted`` counts axioms READ. Each literal an accepted axiom carries has
    a first-order term (``xsd:float``/``xsd:double`` literals and decimals no
    ``Number`` holds exactly are refused HERE, by their datatype, instead of
    failing later), so ``to_kb()`` can render every accepted axiom. So is a
    ``DatatypeDefinition`` that OWL 2 (Structural Specification §9.4) does not
    allow given the definitions read before it: one that closes a cycle with
    them, or gives a datatype a second and different definition, is a
    :class:`RefusedAxiom` with ``keyword == "DatatypeDefinition"`` and the same
    reason :func:`parse_owl_functional` raises with, and it is not stored (the
    definitions before it are). An identical repeat of a definition is the same
    axiom and is accepted. ``to_kb()`` may still refuse the knowledge base as a
    WHOLE, for what no single axiom shows: one name used both as an object
    property and a data property or both as a class and a datatype (OWL 2 DL
    forbids it, and the image has one predicate per name), or
    ``OwlThing``/``OwlData`` used as a name.
