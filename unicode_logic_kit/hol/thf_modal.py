"""Full-family modal THF export — a Benzmüller-style higher-order shallow embedding.

This module extends :func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml.to_thf_modal` (which only handles
the *alethic* ``□`` / ``◇`` fragment plus object quantifiers and **raises** on the
other modalities) to the **full modal family** the toolkit's AST can express:

- alethic        ``□φ`` / ``◇φ``                         over relation ``r``;
- epistemic      ``K_a φ``  (``Knows(agent, φ)``)        over an AGENT-INDEXED ``rk``;
- doxastic       ``B_a φ``  (``Believes(agent, φ)``)     over an AGENT-INDEXED ``rb``;
- assertive      ``Say_a φ`` (``Says(agent, φ)``)        over an AGENT-INDEXED ``rs``;
- bouletic       ``Want_a φ`` (``Wants(agent, φ)``)      over an AGENT-INDEXED ``rw``;
- deontic        ``Oφ`` / ``Pφ``                         over a SERIAL relation ``d``;
- temporal       ``Gφ`` / ``Fφ`` / ``Xφ``               over ``t`` / ``tnext``, with the
  past mirrors ``⒣`` / ``⒫`` / ``⒴`` over the CONVERSE relations and strong
  ``Ⓤ`` / ``⒮`` as impredicative least fixpoints (``muntil`` / ``msince``);
- hybrid         nominals ``i`` and ``@i φ``             as ``mu`` world constants.

It is a genuine higher-order shallow embedding (SSE): a modal proposition is a
function ``mu > $o`` (world → bool), the modalities are λ-lifted quantifiers over the
relevant accessibility relation, and object quantifiers are ``existsAt``-guarded
(actualist). The emitted THF problem is **complete and self-contained** — type
declarations, every lifted operator, frame axioms (per relation where relevant),
domain axioms, and the conjecture ``mvalid @ ⟨formula⟩`` — ready for a higher-order
ATP (Leo-III, Satallax). As elsewhere in the toolkit, this module only *emits* the
problem; it does **not** run any prover.

Faithfulness to :func:`unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal`:

- epistemic/doxastic accessibility is **agent-indexed**. The agent of ``Knows`` /
  ``Believes`` is a first-class TERM (Variable or Constant). In THF it becomes a real
  ``$i`` argument of the relation: ``rk : $i > mu > mu > $o`` and
  ``mknows = ^[A:$i, Phi:mu>$o, W:mu] : ![V:mu] : (rk @ A @ W @ V) => Phi @ V``. A bound
  object variable in agent position (``∀x (Student(x) → K_x φ)``) is bound by the
  embedding's ``mforall`` (which binds an ``$i`` variable), so it correctly quantifies
  over agents — exactly mirroring ``satisfies_modal``'s per-agent ``"K:"+agent`` /
  ``"B:"+agent`` relations. Named agents become ordinary ``$i`` constants (the same
  individual sort as object-quantifier variables), so an agent can also be an object.
- deontic ``O`` / ``P`` are a box / diamond over a **serial** relation ``d`` (Standard
  Deontic Logic, KD), matching the evaluator's serial ``"deontic"`` relation; the
  serial axiom is always emitted for ``d``.
- temporal ``G`` / ``F`` / ``X`` are box / diamond / box over ``t`` / ``tnext`` — but
  **note** the one-step-vs-closure caveat below.
- equality ``=`` / ``≠`` is **rigid identity**, THF's own ``=`` with no world argument —
  the reading of :func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml.qml_is_valid` (and of
  :func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml.to_thf_modal`, byte-compatible on the conjecture).
  See "Equality" below. (``satisfies_modal`` has no term semantics and REFUSES an
  equality atom by name; it is not the oracle for identity.)

Equality
--------
An identity atom ``t₁ = t₂`` is lifted through one extra macro, ``meq``, emitted only
when the formula contains identity:
``meq = ^ [A: $i, B: $i, W: mu] : ( A = B )`` — THF's native ``=`` over the individual
sort ``$i``, with a world binder ``W`` the body never mentions, so it takes **no
world argument** and cannot vary by world. ``t₁ ≠ t₂`` is lowered to ``¬(t₁ = t₂)``
first, exactly as :func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml.qml_translate` does (the lowering is
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml._st_equality` itself, reached through
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.isabelle_modal._lower_identity`), and a non-binary ``=`` /
``≠`` atom raises ``ValueError``, as in ``qml``. Nothing is declared for identity — no
``feq`` / ``fneq`` functor exists in the emitted problem — so a prover gets
reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and congruence (hence Leibniz's law, for ``mbox``
too) from its own equality, not from an axiom.

Identity ranges over the whole individual sort ``$i`` and is **not** existence-guarded
(``qml``'s documented varying-domain choice): ``a = a`` is a theorem at a world where
``a`` does not exist, whereas ``∃x (x = c)`` — which goes through the
``existsAt``-guarded ``mexists`` — is a theorem under ``constant`` / ``possibilist``
and not under the actualist modes. ``a = b → □(a = b)``, ``a ≠ b → □(a ≠ b)`` and
``◇(a = b) → a = b`` are theorems under ``frame='K'``; ``□(a = b) → a = b`` is NOT
(a dead-end world) and is one exactly when the frame is reflexive or serial. The
ordering atoms ``<`` ``>`` ``≤`` ``≥`` remain ordinary world-relativized predicates, as in
``qml``.

CAVEAT — temporal closure. ``satisfies_modal`` reads ``G``/``F`` over the
*reflexive-transitive closure* of the temporal relation, and ``X`` over the immediate
successors. A first-order / higher-order shallow embedding cannot express transitive
closure (it is not first-order definable). This module therefore embeds:

- ``Xφ`` as a box over the **one-step** relation ``tnext`` — faithful to
  ``satisfies_modal`` on the *universal* "all next states" reading of ``Next``;
- ``Gφ`` / ``Fφ`` as box / diamond over ``t`` **made reflexive and transitive** by the
  emitted ``t_refl`` / ``t_trans`` frame axioms. On a frame whose ``t`` is already its
  own reflexive-transitive closure the embedding coincides with the evaluator; in
  general the embedding's ``G``/``F`` quantify over the *transitive closure of the
  emitted ``t``*, which is the standard SSE rendering of LTL ``G``/``F`` but is only an
  **approximation** of ``satisfies_modal``'s closure over the caller's raw temporal
  edges. ``Until`` / ``Since`` **are supported**: TH0 quantifies over predicates, so
  strong Until/Since embed directly as the impredicative Knaster–Tarski least
  fixpoints ``muntil`` / ``msince`` over the one-step ``tnext`` — the same least
  fixpoint Isabelle's ``inductive muntil`` compiles to.

  The two temporal relations are **linked** by the emitted ``tnext_in_t`` inclusion
  axiom ``![W,V]: (tnext @ W @ V) => (t @ W @ V)``. In ``satisfies_modal`` ``X`` reads
  the immediate successors of the *single* ``"temporal"`` relation while ``G``/``F``
  read its reflexive-transitive closure, so every one-step ``X``-successor is reachable
  by ``G``/``F``; the inclusion axiom reproduces exactly that containment in the
  embedding. Without it ``Gφ→Xφ`` — valid for the evaluator — was a non-theorem of the
  emitted problem (``t`` and ``tnext`` were unconstrained relative to each other); with
  it ``Gφ→Xφ`` (and ``Xφ→Fφ`` wherever the evaluator agrees) is now a theorem of the
  embedding.

Cross-family bridges (``bridges=``). ``frame=`` and ``systems=`` each constrain ONE
relation; a *bridge* relates two relations of different families and is therefore a
separate, opt-in option — ``knowledge_implies_belief`` (``K_a φ → B_a φ``, condition
``rb ⊆ rk``, axiom ``rb_in_rk``), ``sincerity`` (``Say_a φ → B_a φ``, ``rb ⊆ rs``,
``rb_in_rs``) and ``ought_implies_can`` (``Oφ → ◇φ``, ``∀W ∃V. d W V ∧ r W V``,
``d_meets_r``). The names, the required families and the axiom names are
single-sourced from :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.isabelle_modal`, so the two HOL routes
cannot drift apart. Each condition is the *exact* correspondent of its schema,
measured against :func:`satisfies_modal` over every frame on ≤ 2 worlds — in
particular ``ought_implies_can`` is deliberately NOT the folklore inclusion
``d ⊆ r``, which on its own does not validate ``Oφ → ◇φ`` at all and which, with
seriality, additionally validates the strictly stronger ``□φ → Oφ``. Requesting a
bridge whose partner family does not occur in the formula raises ``ValueError``
here too — see :func:`_thf_bridge_axioms` for why this route refuses even though
its relations are all declared unconditionally.

UNDECIDABILITY / honesty. First-order modal logic is **undecidable** — though the
standard systems emitted here (K/T/S4/S5, deontic KD) are still *semi-decidable*:
validity is recursively enumerable. (Higher-order modal logic and full second-order
logic are *not even semi-decidable*.) "Emit a problem a prover may discharge" is the
honest claim — never "decide every instance". The propositional
fragments (modal K/T/S4/S5, deontic KD) are decidable, but this export targets the
quantified family, so a ``Theorem`` verdict depends on an external HOL ATP and is not
guaranteed to terminate.

    seriality, over-validates ``□φ → Oφ``. Emission order follows the shared
    registry, not the caller's set-iteration order, so the output is deterministic.

    Honest contract — why this route REFUSES a bridge whose partner family does not
    occur in the formula, even though it could emit it. Unlike the Isabelle route,
    every relation here is declared unconditionally (the ``_THF_DEFS_FULL`` macro
    block references them all), so ``d_meets_r`` for a ``□``-only formula would be
    perfectly well-formed THF. Emitting it anyway would nonetheless be wrong twice

    :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.hol.isabelle_modal.to_isabelle_modal` on the same input

    is not conservative, since ``d_meets_r`` entails seriality of the alethic ``r``
    and so silently turns ``□P → ◇P`` from a non-theorem into a theorem under
    ``frame='K'``. Silently skipping it would be worse still (a weaker logic than

    Unlike :func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml.to_thf_modal` (alethic-only), this covers the

    ``K_a`` and doxastic ``B_a``, deontic ``O``/``P`` (serial / KD), and temporal
    ``G``/``F``/``X``. It produces a self-contained THF problem — type declarations,

    ``mode``, and the conjecture ``mvalid @ ⟨formula⟩`` — ready for a higher-order ATP
    (Leo-III / Satallax). The toolkit only emits the problem; it does not run a prover.

    A many-sorted formula also gets its sort facts, as ``axiom`` lines beside the
    conjecture: ``nonempty_sort<i>`` (the sort is non-empty at every world) and, per
    sorted constant ``c:S``, ``sort_member<i>`` (``! [W: mu] : ( S @ c @ W )``: ``c`` is
    an element of ``S`` at EVERY world, unguarded by ``existsAt``, because a constant is
    rigid and may lie outside the domain of a world). A sort that occurs only through
    a sorted constant gets its guard declared too. A formula without a sorted constant
    gets no ``sort_member`` line and its text is unchanged.

    Parameters:
        formula: the modal formula to embed.
        mode: object-quantifier domain regime — ``"constant"`` / ``"possibilist"``
            (unrelativised) or ``"varying"`` / ``"increasing"`` / ``"cumulative"`` /
            ``"decreasing"`` (actualist, ``existsAt``-guarded).
        frame: constrains the ALETHIC relation ``r`` (K/T/S4/S5/KD/KD45).
        systems: optional per-family system selection for the AGENT-INDEXED epistemic /
            doxastic / assertive / bouletic relations, e.g. ``{"epistemic": "S5",
            "doxastic": "KD45"}``. Each value is a frame name from
            ``{K,T,S4,S5,KD,KD45}``; the property is asserted ``∀A`` over the agent, so
            it holds per agent.
        temporal_closure: emit the ``t_refl`` / ``t_trans`` axioms making ``t``
            reflexive-transitive (default). ``False`` keeps only the ``tnext ⊆ t``
            inclusion, so ``t`` denotes an arbitrary relation — mirroring
            ``isabelle_modal_theory``'s parameter of the same name.
        bridges: optional collection of CROSS-family bridge names (:data:`BRIDGES`,
            shared verbatim with ``hol.isabelle_modal``), **off by default**:
            ``"knowledge_implies_belief"`` (``K_a φ → B_a φ``, axiom ``rb_in_rk``,
            condition ``rb ⊆ rk``), ``"sincerity"`` (``Say_a φ → B_a φ``,
            ``rb_in_rs``, ``rb ⊆ rs``) and ``"ought_implies_can"`` (``Oφ → ◇φ``,
            ``d_meets_r``, ``∀W ∃V. d W V ∧ r W V`` — NOT the folklore ``d ⊆ r``).
            Each condition is the exact correspondent of its schema, so a bridge
            adds that principle and nothing stronger. Requesting a bridge whose
            partner family does not occur in the formula raises ``ValueError``,
            matching ``to_isabelle_modal`` even though the axiom would be
            well-formed here — see :func:`_thf_bridge_axioms`.

    Agent-indexedness (faithful to ``satisfies_modal``): the agent of ``Knows`` /
    ``Believes`` / ``Says`` / ``Wants`` is a first-class TERM and is carried into
    ``rk`` / ``rb`` / ``rs`` / ``rw`` as a real ``$i`` argument, so a bound object
    variable in agent position quantifies over agents
    (``∀x (Student(x) → K_x φ)``). A named agent becomes an ordinary ``$i`` constant.

    Caveats: ``Until`` / ``Since`` ARE supported — as the impredicative
    Knaster–Tarski least-fixpoint macros ``muntil`` / ``msince`` over the one-step
    ``tnext`` (TH0 quantifies over predicates, so the least fixpoint is directly
    expressible). Temporal ``G``/``F`` are read over a reflexive-transitive ``t`` and
    only approximate ``satisfies_modal``'s closure over the caller's raw temporal
    edges (see the module docstring). Equality ``=`` / ``≠`` is RIGID identity — THF's
    own ``=`` with no world argument, through the ``meq`` macro (``≠`` lowered to
    ``¬(=)``) — the reading of :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml.qml_is_valid`, so
    ``a = a`` and ``a = b → □(a = b)`` are theorems and ``□(a = b) → a = b`` is one
    exactly under a reflexive / serial ``frame`` (module docstring, "Equality").
    First-order/higher-order modal logic is undecidable, so a ``Theorem`` verdict
    requires an external HOL ATP and is not guaranteed to terminate.
