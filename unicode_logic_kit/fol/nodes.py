"""Public re-export hub for all AST node classes and utilities.

Classical FOL definitions live in _fol_nodes.py.
MSFL extension (sorted quantifiers/constants, Łukasiewicz operators, to_fol) lives in _msfl_nodes.py.

STABLE PUBLIC API
------------------
Two things exported from this module are STABLE PUBLIC API, in the sense
that a downstream consumer is meant to build directly on them rather than
reaching past them into the modules underneath (``_fol_nodes.py``,
``_msfl_nodes.py``, …, all underscore-prefixed precisely because THEY are
not the contract):

  * every node class's CONSTRUCTOR — ``Variable``, ``Constant``, ``Number``,
    ``Function``, ``Atom``, ``Not``, ``And``, ``Or``, ``Xor``, ``Implies``,
    ``Iff``, ``Quantifier``, ``Count``, ``Measure``, ``Cardinality``,
    ``Contrast``, and every MSFL/modal/hybrid/team/linear/lambek/
    second-order class re-exported below — meaning field names, field
    order, and what a positional or keyword argument means;
  * ``Node.to_unicode_str()``, meaning both that it renders a parseable
    Unicode formula string, and that the string it renders parses back
    (via the matching ``MSFLParser`` mode) to a structurally equal node —
    the roundtrip guarantee documented on ``to_unicode_str`` itself and
    exercised by the FOL-fragment roundtrip test suite. A constant whose name
    does not read back as that constant when written bare (``k2`` is a
    variable, ``Alice`` a predicate, ``G-910`` no term) is written in single
    quotes, ``'k2'``, so that the text reads back for every constant that has
    a text; a constant that reads back bare (``socrates``) is written as it
    always was.

A consumer that builds nodes by calling these constructors directly and
serialises them back to text via ``to_unicode_str`` — the way a mutation-
search loop assembling candidate formulas and shipping them across a
process boundary would — is standing on committed API, not on an
implementation detail that happens to work today.

What "stable" commits this kit to: a node class is not renamed, its
dataclass fields are not reordered or reinterpreted, and ``to_unicode_str``'s
grammar does not change in a way that breaks the roundtrip for an existing
node shape, without that change being called out explicitly in
``CHANGELOG.md`` — never folded silently into an unrelated change. This
project is pre-1.0 (see ``CHANGELOG.md``'s header: "a minor release MAY
contain breaking changes"), so a break is not impossible — but for these
names it is never an accident. ``Node.__eq__`` / ``__hash__`` / ``repr`` /
``to_dict`` / ``from_dict`` are part of the same commitment: unchanged for
every node already registered in ``NODE_CLASSES``.

What it does NOT commit to: anything not re-exported here or in
``fol/__init__.py``'s ``__all__`` — internal helpers, the exact
``_child_nodes()``/``map_children`` traversal order, or any
underscore-prefixed name in any ``_*_nodes.py`` module. The separate, PATH
convention ``replace_at``/``node_at``/``fol.spans.traverse`` agree on
(``_child_nodes()`` order, except a ``Quantifier``'s bound variable is
excluded — see ``_fol_nodes.py``'s "Public tree editing" section and
``fol/spans.py``'s module docstring) is its own narrower commitment, scoped
to those three functions.

# CLONING way the third-order modes above are -- but plain _clone_parser_ops
# is not quite enough here, for a reason the third-order clones never hit:
# "modal" and "second_order" each register the UNSORTED individual quantifier
# (Quantifier, rule alias "quantifier_") and the unsorted counting quantifier
# (Count, "count_"), while "msfol" registers the SORTED equivalents
# (SortedQuantifier "sorted_quantifier_", SortedCount "sorted_count_") under
# DIFFERENT rule aliases / grammar fragments. _clone_parser_ops's dedup key is
# (level, rule_alias, grammar, only_name) -- since the sorted and unsorted
# forms differ on every one of those, a bare clone of ["modal", "msfol"]
# would keep BOTH, so ``MSFLParser(modal=True, many_sorted=True)`` would
# accept an UNSORTED ``∀x P(x)`` right alongside ``∀x:S P(x)`` -- silently
# reintroducing the unsorted quantifier many_sorted is supposed to forbid
# (exactly like plain "msfol" forbids it today). _clone_parser_ops_sorted
# below is _ho_nodes._clone_parser_ops with one addition: ops whose rule_alias
# names an unsorted binder are skipped, so the sorted mode ends up with
# EXACTLY "msfol"'s quantifier/count/constant/cardinality forms plus every
# modal / second-order operator, and nothing double-registered (the classical
# connectives and Contrast register identically -- same level/rule_alias/
# grammar/only_name -- for "modal"/"second_order" and "msfol", so the
# ordinary dedup already collapses those to one copy each).

#   - a third-order mode takes the argument layer of "third_order" (``hoarglist``).
# The predicate quantifier is unsorted in every one of them: ``∀P`` ranges over
# the relations on the whole domain, and a sort restricts an individual binder.

# and its individual quantifier from "fl" ("msfl" over sorted individuals) and,
# from the classical modes, only what is NOT a connective: the modal family and
# the predicate quantifier. A classical connective taken along would give one
# glyph two rules.
#
# The counting forms (``∃≥n``, ``but``) are left out with the connectives, as

# cardinality terms are no part of "fl" either, so no fuzzy mode has them.
