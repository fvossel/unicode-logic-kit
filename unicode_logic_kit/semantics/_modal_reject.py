"""Shared "out-of-scope node" rejection helpers for the two-valued modal back-ends.

The Kripke evaluator (:mod:`kripke`) and the standard translation
(:mod:`..fol.modal_translation`) are two-valued. Łukasiewicz (fuzzy) operators
and lambda-calculus nodes are out of scope there and are rejected uniformly here
with a clear NotImplementedError, so the message wording stays consistent across
the two modules. (The graded evaluator :mod:`fuzzy_kripke`, which reads the
Łukasiewicz operators, shares the lambda refusal.)

An **equality atom** (``a = b`` / ``a ≠ b``) is out of scope for every route
that has no TERM semantics, and :func:`reject_equality` is the one place that
says so: a propositional route reads an atom as a world-relative proposition
keyed by its rendered form, so ``=`` could only be an uninterpreted relation
there, and silently treating identity as one is the kind of approximation this
kit refuses. The propositional modal tableau (:mod:`..atp.modal_tableau`) and the
intuitionistic GMT embedding (:mod:`..hol.intuitionistic`) share it; the message
is parameterised by the route it speaks for.

    atom (why it cannot read identity), ``consequence`` says what goes wrong if it
    reads the atom anyway, and ``instead`` is the sentence that points elsewhere.
    The defaults are the Kripke evaluator's, so a caller that passes only ``node``
    and ``caller`` gets exactly its message. ``consequence`` is separate from
    ``atom_reading`` because the two are not the same claim: a propositional route
    reads an atom by its rendered key AND therefore gets 'a = a' false, while a
