"""Which parser serves which mode, and why the swap is allowed to be invisible.

Up to 0.23.1 every mode was parsed with Earley. Earley is the right default for
a grammar that needs it; this one does not. Asked for every derivation
(``ambiguity="explicit"``), the classical grammar produces exactly one for all
1260 parsable lines of the 1310-line FOLIO fixture, so Earley was paying for a capability the grammar
never used -- measured at 30x to 50x, mode by mode, on the kit's own corpus.

Since 0.23.2 every mode is parsed with LALR as its FAST path. Two modes,
``modal`` and ``tomodal`` (``_HYBRID_MODES``), cannot move to LALR outright --
a genuine LALR(1) reduce/reduce conflict (documented at ``_HYBRID_MODES`` in
msflparser.py) makes plain LALR silently commit to the wrong reading for one
narrow shape (a bracket-grouped formula headed by a bare lowercase
NAME/VARIABLE) and then fail a few tokens later. Since 0.28.0 those two modes
get an LALR-first, EARLEY-FALLBACK wrapper instead of plain Earley:
``MSFLParser`` tries its LALR parser first and retries with Earley,
transparently, only on the rare input that shape describes -- see
``MSFLParser._parse_tree``. This module is the evidence that none of this
changes anything a caller can observe: every test below now runs against
every mode, hybrid ones included, checked against a live Earley parser built
from the same grammar rather than against recorded strings, so it keeps
testing the real question if the grammar changes. The soundness half of the
hybrid wrapper -- that wherever its LALR fast path itself accepts, it builds
the SAME tree Earley would -- gets its own dedicated (much larger, randomly
generated) corpus in tests/test_modal_lalr_fallback.py; this file's job is
the accept/reject/span/error-message differential, run the same way for
every mode.

The one thing the swap DOES change is where a failure surfaces. Earley's
dynamic lexer only offers tokens the parser can currently use, so a well-formed
symbol in the wrong place never became a token -- it stayed an unscannable
character, and the kit reported a NamingError. LALR tokenises first and refuses
afterwards, so the same input arrives as UnexpectedToken. The mapping back
(`MSFLParser._token_failure`) was derived by measuring both parsers over the
corpus, and the split turned out to be exact rather than approximate: every
input Earley failed with UnexpectedEOF becomes UnexpectedToken on `$END`, and
every input it failed with UnexpectedCharacters becomes UnexpectedToken on
something else. Both directions are pinned below. A hybrid mode's fallback
-exhausted failure (both LALR and Earley refuse) is reported through Earley's
OWN untranslated exception instead -- see MSFLParser._token_failure's
``_from_earley_fallback`` branch -- so it needs no separate mapping here.
