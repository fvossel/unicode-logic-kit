"""Three-valued (Kleene K3 / Priest LP) evaluation of classical FOL formulas.

The strong-Kleene tables interpret the classical connectives over the chain
``{0.0, 0.5, 1.0}`` — read as *false*, *undefined/both*, *true*::

    ¬x       = 1 − x
    a ∧ b    = min(a, b)
    a ∨ b    = max(a, b)
    a → b    = max(1 − a, b)                     (material implication)
    a ↔ b    = min(a → b, b → a)
    a ⊕ b    = min(max(a, b), 1 − min(a, b))     (a ∨ b) ∧ ¬(a ∧ b)

These are the *same* truth functions for K3 and LP; the two logics differ only
in which values count as **designated** (truth-preserved):

    K3 designates {1.0}            — only plain truth
    LP designates {0.5, 1.0}       — "true" or "both" (Priest's paraconsistent LP)

That single choice produces the headline contrasts: the law of excluded middle
``P ∨ ¬P`` is K3-invalid but LP-valid, and LP is paraconsistent — ``P, ¬P`` does
*not* entail an arbitrary ``Q`` — while K3 fails non-contradiction validity.

This module operates on **classical** AST nodes (Atom, Not, And, Or, Xor,
Implies, Iff, Quantifier) parsed by ``MSFLParser()`` — no new grammar. Truth
values are the floats ``0.0``, ``0.5`` and ``1.0``. A *valuation* maps a ground
atom's key (the text it prints as, with every constant written by its name, e.g.
``'P'`` or ``'P(a)'``, also for a constant named ``a`` that the text of the formula
writes in quotes, ``P('a')``, which is read as the same key) to one of those three values.
The nullary atoms ``$true`` and
``$false`` (``⊤`` and ``⊥``) are not letters of the formula but the constants truth and falsity: they have the value
``1.0`` and ``0.0`` under every valuation, and an enumeration does not vary them.

Quantifiers are read substitutionally over a finite ``domain`` of constant
names, exactly as in the fuzzy evaluator: ``∀`` is the minimum and ``∃`` the
maximum of the body's value over the domain (∀ = "all", ∃ = "some"). A domain
is required whenever a quantifier is present.

A variable that is free in a formula that is decided together with a quantifier (the
deciders :func:`is_valid`, :func:`is_satisfiable` and :func:`entails`, and their
counterparts in :mod:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.matrix`) is a PARAMETER: one unknown
element of the domain, the same in every formula of the problem. The decider tries each
assignment of the domain's elements to the problem's free variables: a formula is valid
(a consequence) when it is so under every assignment and satisfiable when it is so
under some. ``∀y P(y) → P(x)`` is therefore LP-valid over ``{a, b}`` (the parameter ``x``
is ``a`` or ``b``), ``P(x) ⊢ ∃y P(y)`` is a consequence (whichever element ``x`` is, ``P``
of it is one of the disjuncts), and ``P(x), Q(y) ⊢ ∀z (P(z) ∧ Q(z))`` is not. Where no
quantifier is present the domain says nothing about a variable, and the atom ``P(x)`` is a
letter of its own, exactly as ``P(a)`` is. The evaluator (:func:`kleene_value`) takes the
valuation as it stands: the atom ``P(x)`` of a free variable is one more key of it.

An atom is a letter named by the text it prints as. Two different atoms that print alike
(the numeral ``1`` and a constant named ``1``, a free variable ``x`` and a constant named
``x``) would be read as one letter, so a problem that has such a pair is refused by name.

Łukasiewicz (fuzzy), sorted, lambda, and modal nodes carry no classical
three-valued reading here and raise ``NotImplementedError``. A sorted constant
(``alice:Human``) is refused the same way wherever it stands, inside an atom as well:
that ``alice`` lies in ``Human`` is a fact about the sort which the three truth
values have no statement of, and reading ``Human(alice)`` as unrelated to it would
answer another question.
