"""Standard (relational) translation of propositional modal logic into FOL.

The *standard translation* ST embeds the propositional modal fragment into
classical first-order logic over an explicit "current world" term, so that the
existing FOL back-ends (Z3, Prover9, TPTP, the resolution engine, the Tarski
evaluator) can reason about modal formulas. A modal formula is true at a world
*w* in a Kripke model exactly when its translation ``ST(φ, w)`` is true in the
corresponding first-order structure (worlds as the domain, accessibility
relations and atom-predicates as the relations) — this correspondence is what
``tests/test_modal_translation.py`` cross-checks against
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal`.

Translation scheme, with ``w`` the current-world variable and ``w'`` a FRESH
world variable (names ``w0, w1, …`` are generated so nested modalities never
capture each other; the free current-world name and every variable name of
the formula are skipped, so even a caller who passes ``world="w0"`` keeps a
distinct, uncaptured free variable, and an atom ``P(w0)`` keeps its own ``w0``):

- ``Atom A`` (propositional / ground) → ``A(w)``: the atom's predicate is
  applied to the current world. A nullary atom ``P`` becomes ``P(w)``; an atom
  ``Likes(a, b)`` becomes ``Likes(a, b, w)`` (the world is appended as the last
  argument, so ground arguments are preserved).
- ``Not / And / Or / Xor / Implies / Iff`` — map through structurally at the
  same world.
- ``Box φ``      → ``∀w' (R(w, w') → ST(φ, w'))``.
- ``Diamond φ``  → ``∃w' (R(w, w') ∧ ST(φ, w'))``.
- ``Knows(a, φ)``    → ``∀w' (Rk_a(w, w') → ST(φ, w'))``.
- ``Believes(a, φ)`` → ``∀w' (Rb_a(w, w') → ST(φ, w'))``.
- ``EverybodyKnows(G, φ)`` (E_G, "everyone in G knows φ") →
  ``⋀_{a∈G} ∀w' (Rk_a(w, w') → ST(φ, w'))`` — a per-agent :class:`Knows`
  translation for every member of ``G``, ANDed together (one-step; union of
  relations ≡ conjunction of boxes). Empty ``G`` is rejected (see Scope below).
- ``DistributedKnowledge(G, φ)`` (D_G, "φ is distributed knowledge in G") →
  ``∀w' ((⋀_{a∈G} Rk_a(w, w')) → ST(φ, w'))`` — ONE box over the
  INTERSECTION of the group's relations (every ``Rk_a(w,w')`` conjunct must
  hold of the SAME ``w'``), not a per-agent conjunction of separate boxes.
- ``Says(a, φ)``     → ``∀w' (Rs_a(w, w') → ST(φ, w'))`` (assertive: box over
  a per-agent "compatible with what a says" relation).
- ``Wants(a, φ)``    → ``∀w' (Rw_a(w, w') → ST(φ, w'))`` (bouletic: box over
  a per-agent desire relation).
- ``Always φ``     → ``∀w' (T(w, w') → ST(φ, w'))`` (box over a temporal
  accessibility predicate ``T``).
- ``Eventually φ`` → ``∃w' (T(w, w') ∧ ST(φ, w'))`` (diamond over ``T``).
- ``Next φ``       → ``∀w' (N(w, w') → ST(φ, w'))`` (box over a one-step
  predicate ``N``).
- ``Obligatory φ`` → ``∀w' (D(w, w') → ST(φ, w'))`` (box over a deontic
  accessibility predicate ``D``).
- ``Permitted φ``  → ``∃w' (D(w, w') ∧ ST(φ, w'))`` (diamond over ``D``).
- ``Nominal i``  → ``w = nom_i``: a nominal is a world-equality against a
  dedicated world CONSTANT. The ``"nom_"`` prefix keeps these constants out of
  the user's constant namespace, so an atom mentioning a ground constant ``i``
  can never collide with the nominal ``i``. UNLESS ``i`` is currently BOUND by
  an enclosing ``↓i`` (see ``Down`` below), in which case the translation uses
  the bound world TERM instead — the ``bindings`` mechanism, not the ``nom_``
  constant, decides which.
- ``At(i, φ)``   → ``ST(φ, nom_i)``: the satisfaction operator ``@i φ``
  re-anchors the translation at the constant world term ``nom_i`` (the current
  world term is simply replaced — no quantifier is introduced) — again unless
  ``i`` is ``↓``-bound, in which case the bound term replaces ``nom_i``.
- ``Down(x, φ)`` (``↓x.φ``, N1) → ``ST(φ, world)`` with ``x`` now BOUND, for
  the rest of ``φ``'s translation, to the CURRENT WORLD TERM ``world`` — no
  fresh quantifier is introduced (this is the bounded-fragment translation:
  ``↓`` rebinds a name to the current world, it does not existentially
  quantify over worlds). Concretely: every ``Nominal(x)`` / ``At(x, …)`` in
  ``φ`` — down to, but not inside, a nested ``Down(x, …)`` that shadows it —
  translates to ``world`` (or re-anchors at it) instead of to a fresh
  ``nom_x`` constant. This is threaded through ``_translate`` as one extra
  parameter, ``bindings: Dict[str, Node]`` (name → the world TERM it is
  currently bound to), consulted by the ``Nominal``/``At`` cases FIRST,
  falling back to the ``nom_`` scheme only when the name is unbound — so
  ``bindings={}`` (every call site outside ``Down``'s own recursion)
  reproduces the pre-``Down`` translation byte-for-byte. Because ``↓`` makes
  H(@,↓) UNDECIDABLE (unlike plain H(@)), no bare-bool validity check treats
  a ``Down``-containing formula: ``hybrid_is_valid`` refuses it by name;
  :func:`down_is_valid` (below) is the PROVED-only replacement.

Scope / caveats (v1):

- ``Always`` and ``Eventually`` are translated as a **box / diamond over an
  assumed temporal accessibility predicate** ``T``. To make ``Always`` a genuine
  "henceforth" (reflexive-transitive reachability) one would need extra frame
  axioms forcing ``T`` to be reflexive and transitive — that is not pure
  first-order logic (transitive closure is not first-order definable), so it is
  out of scope here. The cross-check in the tests therefore drives the Tarski
  structure with ``T`` interpreted as the SAME one-step ``"temporal"`` relation
  used by the Kripke model, NOT its closure.
- ``Until`` is rejected: strong Until needs the transitive closure of the
  temporal relation, which is not first-order definable.
- ``CommonKnowledge`` (C_G) is rejected for the exact same reason: it needs the
  reflexive-transitive closure of the group's union relation.
- ``EverybodyKnows`` over an EMPTY group is rejected too: ``E_∅ φ`` is
  vacuously true by definition (the union over zero relations is empty, so
  "holds at every successor" holds vacuously), but this grammar has no
  first-order truth constant to render that without borrowing an unrelated
  atom from the caller's own vocabulary. ``DistributedKnowledge`` never
  raises this way — its own constructor already refuses an empty group (see
  ``fol._modal_nodes.DistributedKnowledge``'s docstring).
- ``Quantifier`` / ``SortedQuantifier`` are rejected: first-order (quantified)
  modal logic with object domains is out of scope for v1. So are Łukasiewicz and
  lambda nodes.

The accessibility-predicate names are fixed so the matching Tarski structure can
be built mechanically: ``"R"`` (alethic), ``"Rk_" + agent`` (epistemic),
``"Rb_" + agent`` (doxastic), ``"Rs_" + agent`` (assertive), ``"Rw_" + agent``
(bouletic), ``"T"`` (temporal), ``"N"`` (next), ``"D"`` (deontic).

    ``world`` names the free current-world variable threaded through the
    translation (default ``"w"``); the result is a plain first-order formula in
    which propositional atoms ``A`` become ``A(world)`` and each modality becomes
    a quantification over a fresh world variable bounded by an accessibility
    predicate (see the module docstring for the exact scheme and the fixed
    predicate names). The returned Node uses only classical FOL constructs, so it
    can be handed to ``to_z3`` / ``to_prover9`` / ``to_tptp`` / the Tarski
    evaluator.

    Hybrid constructs translate too: ``Nominal i`` becomes the world-equality
    ``world = nom_i`` and ``At(i, φ)`` becomes ``ST(φ)`` anchored at the constant
    ``nom_i`` (the ``"nom_"`` prefix keeps nominal constants disjoint from user
    constants — see the module docstring).

    The variables of an atom (``P(w0)``) are the caller's own, and so are the names
    the translation mints. The world variables it binds (``w0``, ``w1``, …) never have
    the spelling of a name of ``formula`` (of any kind: variable, constant, predicate,
    nominal, …), of ``world`` or of a name in ``avoid``, compared exactly and with the
    case folded, so ``□P(w0)`` is ``∀w1 (R(w, w1) → P(w0, w1))`` and not a statement
    about the bound world. A variable of ``formula`` that is spelled like ``world``
    would be read as the current world itself, so it is renamed to a name of its own
    (``x0``, …, clear of every name of ``formula``, of ``world`` and of ``avoid``) in
    the image: it stays one free variable, the same in every atom. To translate several
    formulas of one problem separately and keep that name the same in all of them, pass
    the names of the others as ``avoid``.

    A node the classical layer defines by other nodes is read by that definition, the
    one :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.fol.nodes.to_fol` applies: ``Contrast`` is ``∧``, and a
    counting quantifier is its distinct witnesses, so it raises as the object-level
    quantifier it is.

    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: on ``Until`` (not first-order definable), any
            object-level quantifier (first-order modal logic is out of scope for
            v1), a Łukasiewicz node, or a lambda node; and on two different agent
            terms that are named alike (the numeral ``1`` and a constant named ``1``):

    like ``"G(1,1,1,1)"``; a system whose condition has no first-order form
    (GL, S4.1, Grz) is refused by name, because this route is first-order.

    The other families get the conventions :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml` and
    the Isabelle/THF exporters already use, so the routes agree instead of
    contradicting each other:

    - temporal: ``T`` reflexive and transitive (``temporal_closure=True``,
      the default), ``N ⊆ T``, and :func:`_temporal_first_step` when both
      occur — this is what makes ``Ⓖφ → φ``, ``Ⓖφ → Ⓝφ`` and the past mirrors
      come out valid, as the Kripke evaluator reads them (it evaluates
      ``Always``/``Eventually`` over the reflexive-transitive CLOSURE of the
      one-step relation). Until 0.28.1 NOTHING asserted these on this route,
      so ``hybrid_is_valid(Ⓖ P → P, "S5")`` answered False while
      ``qml_is_valid`` on the same formula answered True — a bare "not valid"
      about a formula the kit's own modal semantics validates.
    - deontic: ``D`` serial (Standard Deontic Logic), so ``Ⓞφ → Ⓟφ`` is valid.
    - agent-indexed: nothing unless ``systems`` asks, e.g.
      ``systems={"epistemic": "S5", "doxastic": "KD45"}`` — the families are
      ``epistemic`` / ``doxastic`` / ``assertive`` / ``bouletic`` and an unknown
      one raises. A system for a family the formula never mentions contributes
      nothing (same as ``qml_axioms``).
    - sorted constants: ``c:S`` is an element of ``S`` at EVERY world (a constant is
      a rigid designator), so each distinct ``c:S`` of the formula adds
      ``∀v0 S(c, v0)`` — the sort guard in the translation's own vocabulary (a
      world as last argument), unguarded by any existence predicate, as in
      ``qml_axioms``. Without it ``Human(carl:Human)`` has a countermodel in
      which ``carl`` is no ``Human``, and a route that reads Z3's ``sat`` as
      "refuted" answers wrongly. A sort that occurs only through a constant needs
      no non-emptiness axiom: the constant is its member.

    Every axiom is closed over its own bound variables (``v0``, ``v1``, …), so
    it can never capture anything in the translated formula, and they are
    returned for the caller to pass as SEPARATE premises — never conjoined onto
    the translation itself. The names are deliberately ones the kit's own

    but hybrid logic H(@) over K is DECIDABLE, and the ST images of H(@)
    formulas (two-variable-like, tiny) are well within Z3's reach in practice;
    the frame-axiom variants used here (T/S4/S5) behave the same on these

        NotImplementedError: ``formula`` contains a ``Down`` node (the ↓

# =========================

# down_is_valid is hybrid_is_valid's PROVED-only sibling for the FULL hybrid
# language H(@,↓). It exists as a SEPARATE function, not a keyword flag on
# hybrid_is_valid, precisely because the two make different promises:
# hybrid_is_valid's bare bool is safe only because H(@) over K is decidable
# (so "not proved" IS "refuted" there); down_is_valid must call the Z3
# Solver() directly — never the bare-bool is_valid() wrapper, which collapses
# Z3's 'sat' (a genuine countermodel) and 'unknown' (timeout / incompleteness
# on an undecidable query) into the same False (unicode_logic_kit.atp.z3_models
# .is_valid, confirmed by direct reading) — so it can tell the two apart and
# report them honestly as UNKNOWN, never smuggling a REFUTED claim out of a
# SAT witness this route never verified against a presentable finite
# KripkeModel (that verification is KripkeEnumBackend's job — see
# fol._hybrid_nodes' module docstring and atp.hybrid_down.down_decide, which
# combines the two into one call).

    """Return a :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.atp.protocol.Verdict` for the FULL
    hybrid-modal ``formula`` (H(@,↓), including ``Down``/↓) over ``frame``.

    Builds the exact same goal ``hybrid_is_valid`` does — the standard
    translation, closed over the current world, under the frame axioms
    (``standard_translation`` now threads ``Down``'s local rebinding through,
    see the module docstring) — but decides it with a Z3 ``Solver()`` called
    directly, so ``unsat`` (of the negated goal) and ``sat``/``unknown`` are
    told apart instead of collapsed:

    - Z3 ``unsat`` → ``PROVED`` — sound unconditionally: soundness of a
      Z3-``unsat`` verdict depends only on Z3's own soundness, never on
      whether Z3 is a COMPLETE decision procedure for this (undecidable)
      fragment (see ``fol._hybrid_nodes``' module docstring for the
      co-r.e. argument this rests on: ST is meaning-preserving for H(@,↓)
      — Areces/Blackburn/Marx 1999 — so FO-``unsat``-of-the-negation IS
      H(@,↓)-validity, exactly).
    - Z3 ``sat`` (of the negated goal) → ``UNKNOWN`` / ``reason="incomplete"``
      — NEVER ``REFUTED``. A SAT witness here would, ON INSPECTION, also be a
      sound Kripke countermodel in principle (same correspondence as above,
      run in the other direction) — this is a deliberate COMPLETENESS
      sacrifice, not a soundness requirement, made to sidestep turning an
      arbitrary Z3 model back into a presentable, inspectable finite
      :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.KripkeModel`. Use
      :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.atp.kripke_enum.modal_enum_search` /
      :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.atp.kripke_enum.KripkeEnumBackend` for an
      actual REFUTED verdict, with a countermodel independently
      re-verified by :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal`
      — or :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.atp.hybrid_down.down_decide`, which runs
      both routes and combines them.
    - Z3 times out → ``UNKNOWN`` / ``reason="timeout"``.

    This function decides ANY formula ``standard_translation`` accepts
    (``Down`` or not) — it is not restricted to ↓-containing input; a plain
    H(@) formula is handled identically, just more conservatively than
    ``hybrid_is_valid`` (which, for THAT decidable fragment, is entitled to —
    and does — read Z3 ``sat``/``unknown`` as a genuine countermodel).
