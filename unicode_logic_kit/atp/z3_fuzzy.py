"""Łukasiewicz fuzzy SAT / validity via Z3 reals.

Decides propositional Łukasiewicz formulas by encoding them into Z3 with one
``Real`` variable per distinct ground atom, each constrained to the unit
interval [0, 1]. The truth *degree* of a formula is built as a piecewise-linear
Z3 ``Real`` expression using ``z3.If`` for the min / max / clamp operations.

Atom semantics over [0, 1]:

* ``LukNegation``        ¬a       = 1 − a
* ``WeakConjunction``    a ∧ b    = min(a, b)
* ``WeakDisjunction``    a ∨ b    = max(a, b)
* ``StrongConjunction``  a ⊗ b    = max(0, a + b − 1)
* ``StrongDisjunction``  a ⊕ b    = min(1, a + b)
* ``LukImplication``     a → b    = min(1, 1 − a + b)
* ``LukEquivalence``     a ↔ b    = 1 − |a − b|

An individual quantifier is grounded over a ``domain`` (``sort_universes``) of constant
names into a finite weak ∧ / ∨; without one it is refused. A predicate quantifier
(``∀P`` / ``∃P``) is the infimum / supremum over the fuzzy interpretations of its
predicate and is stated in the arithmetic itself
(:mod:`~unicode_logic_kit.atp.z3_fuzzy_kripke`): ``∀P (P ⊕ ¬P)`` is valid, ``∀P (P ∨ ¬P)``
is not (its degree is ``1/2``). A modal operator has no reading under one valuation and
is refused with a pointer to
:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.atp.z3_fuzzy_kripke.fuzzy_modal_search`.

An atom is a letter named by the text it prints as (a sorted constant ``c:S`` is the
constant ``c``). A third-order atom (``Pos(G)``) is such a letter too: the property is
taken by name, so a formula reported valid is valid whatever ``Pos`` is, and a model
may give ``Pos(G)`` and ``Pos(H)`` different degrees where ``G`` and ``H`` agree. A
comparison atom (``a = a``, ``1 < 2``) has no Łukasiewicz degree and is
refused by name, exactly as :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.fuzzy.evaluate` refuses it,
and so are two different atoms that print alike.
