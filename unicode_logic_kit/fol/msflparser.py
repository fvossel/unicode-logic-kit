# =========================
# Single-letter function-call patch
# =========================
#
# The shared (non-registry) term layer in _fol_nodes.py's grammar template only
# ever lets a NAME (>= 2 letters) head a function call: ``NAME "(" termlist
# ")" -> function_``. A single lowercase letter lexes as VARIABLE instead of
# NAME, and ``?atom_term: VARIABLE`` has no continuation into "(", so
# without the patch below ``f(x)`` fails at the LEXER level (a NamingError: '('
# is not a valid continuation after VARIABLE in that grammar position) even
# though ``Function('f', [...])`` is a perfectly legal AST node whose
# ``to_unicode_str()`` prints ``f(x)``. With the patch that text reads back as
# the function. (The head of a function stays a bare word: a quoted name is a
# constant, and ``'f'(x)`` is refused.) Verified unambiguous (no Earley
# ambiguity against lambda application or the atom/atom_term rules:
# VARIABLE-as-bare-term and VARIABLE-as-function-head are distinguished purely
# by whether "(" follows, and a bare term can never itself reduce to a formula,
# so there is no competing derivation for e.g. "(f)(y)" or
# "(λx. P(x))(f(y))") by building the patched grammar for every mode and
# cross-checking against an ``ambiguity="explicit"`` Earley parser, plus
# running the full parser test suite (test_msfl_parser.py, test_lambda_tools.py,
# test_resolve_lambda_scope.py).
#
# The alternative is applied as a targeted, self-checking patch to the
# ASSEMBLED grammar string and not written into the shared template
# (_fol_nodes.py's _BASE_GRAMMAR_TEMPLATE): the patch splices in a
# ``VARIABLE "(" termlist ")" -> function_`` alternative right next to the
# existing bare-VARIABLE one, and it finds its place by the head line
# ``?atom_term: VARIABLE``, so the template keeps that line exactly as it is
# (the quoted constant is one more alternative after it, not a change to it).
# The patch is applied identically to every mode, since the term layer is
# verbatim-shared across all of them (build_grammar's per-mode variation is
# entirely in the formula-operator layers, not atom_term).

# Compiled Lark parsers are cached per (registry_mode, registry size, algorithm):
# building either grammar is the expensive step, and it depends only on the
# registered ParserOps. Keying on len(PARSER_OPS) rebuilds automatically if an
# operator is registered at runtime (the registry is otherwise frozen after
# import). The algorithm is part of the key because a hybrid mode (below)
# caches BOTH an LALR and an Earley build of the SAME grammar side by side.
_PARSER_CACHE: dict = {}


# Modes that get an LALR-first, Earley-fallback WRAPPER instead of a single
# parser. Every other mode is parsed with plain LALR, which on the kit's own
# corpus is 30-50x faster for identical trees, identical accept/reject sets
# and identical source spans (4815 formula-level span comparisons, zero
# differences) -- measured mode by mode, not assumed.
#
# `modal` is the one that cannot just move to LALR outright, and for a
# specific reason rather than caution: `atom_term`'s `"(" term ")"`
# alternative and `?prefix`'s `"(" formula ")"` alternative (feeding the
# hybrid-logic bare-nominal rule in _hybrid_nodes.py,
# `?nominal.-1: (NAME | VARIABLE)`) share an LALR state after `"("` plus a
# bare lowercase NAME/VARIABLE token. The nominal rule's `-1` priority --
# added for an unrelated lambda-application disambiguation, see
# _hybrid_nodes.py -- makes LALR resolve that shared state's reduce/reduce
# conflict toward the TERM reading even where only the formula/nominal
# reading can lead to a complete parse, so the parser commits to the wrong
# branch several tokens early and then fails outright a few tokens later:
# `(q→p)`, `(p∧q)`, `(p→p)` all raise UnexpectedToken under plain LALR, while
# the same shapes with an uppercase PREDICATE head, e.g. `(P→P)`, succeed
# (verified empirically, not just asserted -- see
# tests/test_parser_backend.py's test_modal_still_accepts_what_only_earley_reaches
# and the soundness differential in tests/test_modal_lalr_fallback.py). Lark
# offers only Earley and LALR(1), and this is a genuine LALR(1) conflict the
# tables resolve by priority, not 8 special-cased strings, so eliminating it
# cleanly would need nontrivial grammar state-splitting with no guaranteed
# clean answer -- exactly the kind of grammar surgery that risks the
# silent-narrowing this project refuses to ship.
#
# So `modal` keeps Earley as a FALLBACK rather than as the mode's parser:
# MSFLParser builds both an LALR parser (the fast path, taken -- and the only
# one taken -- for every input this conflict doesn't touch) and the Earley
# parser (the previous, exact parser for this language), tries LALR first,
# and falls back to Earley transparently on ANY of Lark's three failure
# exceptions (UnexpectedCharacters/UnexpectedToken/UnexpectedEOF -- the
# LALR/Earley disagreement is not confined to one exception class, so
# narrowing the retry to just UnexpectedToken would silently keep exactly the
# narrowing this wrapper exists to remove). Earley remains the ground truth of
# what the mode accepts, and what tree it builds, on every input; LALR only
# ever makes an accepted formula faster to parse, never changes what parses.
# See MSFLParser._parse_tree.
# ``tomodal`` inherits the modal mode's operators wholesale, so it inherits
# the reason too. ``modal_sorted`` (modal=True, many_sorted=True) ALSO
# inherits the modal mode's operators wholesale -- including the hybrid
# nominal rule -- via _clone_parser_ops_sorted (fol/nodes.py), so it inherits
# the same LALR/Earley conflict and needs the same fallback. ``to`` (classical
# third order) and ``so_sorted`` (second_order=True, many_sorted=True) do not
# inherit any hybrid/modal operator, and parse with plain LALR like the modes
# they extend. The same line divides the other combinations: every mode that
# holds the modal family (``somodal``, ``somodal_sorted``, ``tomodal_sorted``)
# inherits the conflict and the fallback, and ``to_sorted`` parses with plain
# LALR. A fuzzy mode has the nominal rule exactly when its classical
# counterpart has it, so the line is the same there.

# Span-capturing transform (used only by MSFLParser.parse_with_spans)
# =========================
#
# Lark's Transformer routes EVERY rule reduction through _call_userfunc(tree,
# new_children) and every token through _call_userfunc_token(token) (see
# lark.visitors.Transformer) — tree.meta (with propagate_positions=True, set
# above) and the token itself both already carry exact source positions.
# Overriding just these two dispatch hooks lets us record spans for whatever
# Node each already-existing handler produces, WITHOUT changing a single
# handler in FOLTransformer / LambdaTransformer / the operator registry: every
# rule alias still runs exactly the function build_transform_handlers attaches
# for plain parse() (level2/fold aliases are the one exception — see
# _fold_level2 below — and even those build the exact same node graph
# _fold_binary would, just with span bookkeeping alongside), we just
# additionally look at the Tree/Token that was being reduced once the
# (unmodified) handler has returned.
#
# TWO id()-keyed dicts are built (id_extent, id_head) — see spans.py's
# build_span_map docstring for why id() is fine here: it is a transient,
# same-call-only bookkeeping device, never exposed past this transform. Once
# the whole tree has been transformed, MSFLParser.parse_with_spans turns
# these into the PATH-keyed, spec-correct SpanMap it actually returns.
#
# HEAD SPANS — THE LARK-FILTERING PROBLEM AND WHY THIS DOES NOT USE
# keep_all_tokens=True
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every classical connective (¬ ∧ ∨ → ↔ ⊕) and every infix comparison
# (= < > ≤ ≥ ≠) is declared as an ANONYMOUS string-literal terminal inline in
# the grammar (e.g. '"¬" prefix' -> not_), and Lark auto-filters an anonymous
# literal out of the parse tree by default — so its own token never reaches
# _call_userfunc's new_children, and there is no tree.meta for the head
# position on its own (only the whole rule's meta is available).
#
# The obvious fix, building the span parser with keep_all_tokens=True, was
# tried and rejected: it does not just ADD the filtered tokens back, it also
# defeats Lark's "?rule inlines away when it reduces to one child after
# filtering" mechanism that '?prefix: … | "(" formula ")"' relies on to make
# a parenthesised subexpression collapse straight through to its inner
# node — with keep_all_tokens=True the "(" and ")" survive as extra children,
# the alternative no longer has one child, so it stops inlining and instead
# becomes an un-aliased Tree('prefix', [...]) with NO transform handler
# (Transformer.__default__ returns it as a bare Tree, not a Node) — breaking
# AST construction for every parenthesised subformula. It was also going to
# require a SECOND compiled Lark parser (a second Earley grammar build),
# which the "do not change parse()'s performance" requirement rules out for
# the shared, cached self.parser — and a keep_all_tokens tree also does not
# feed the mode's OWN registered handlers (not_, and_, …) unmodified, since
# those handlers are written for the filtered item shape; reusing them would
# need re-deriving the filtering by hand anyway.
#
# So this uses the parser exactly as parse() does (propagate_positions,
# no keep_all_tokens, same cached Lark instance — parse()'s own behaviour and
# performance are untouched) and recovers each head position from what IS
# already available without keep_all_tokens:
#   * FORALL/EXISTS, COUNTOP: NAMED terminals are never auto-filtered, so the
#     raw Token is already sitting in new_children — no scan needed. A
#     quantifier's head is [that token's start, the bound Variable's own
#     already-known extent end) — which is exactly "symbol + variable +
#     whatever whitespace sits between them", satisfying A5 directly.
#   * PREDICATE (an atom's head): also a named terminal, same story — the raw
#     token is new_children[0] for atom_/atom0_.
#   * A prefix op's glyph (¬, and any future one driven by the OPERATORS
#     registry's fixity=="prefix"): always the FIRST thing the rule matches
#     (tree.meta.start_pos), so the head is simply
#     [meta.start_pos, meta.start_pos + len(glyph)) — no scan needed either.
#   * A binary infix glyph (→, ↔, and every comparison predicate) and a
#     same-level fold's connective (∧, ∨, ⊕, Ⓒ): genuinely filtered, with no
#     token anywhere to read a position off. These are located by
#     spans.find_glyph, searching the SOURCE TEXT for the operator's own
#     glyph within the gap between the two operands' own already-known
#     (inner) extents. That gap can be WIDER than "just whitespace" — an
#     operand may carry its own redundant wrapping parentheses, which its
#     inner extent (per A5 item 3) deliberately excludes — but find_glyph
#     searches for the EXACT glyph text rather than "the first non-whitespace
#     run", which is what makes that safe (no parenthesis can equal the
#     glyph). See spans.find_glyph's docstring.
#
# A SAME-LEVEL FOLD gets special handling on top of this (_fold_level2): only
# the OUTERMOST fold result is directly dispatched by Lark (see
# spans.py's module docstring for why), so every INTERMEDIATE left-fold node
# is built manually here, in lockstep with locating each connective
# occurrence — see _fold_level2's own docstring for why the intermediate's
# own EXTENT cannot be the naive union of its two operands' inner extents
# either (same "an operand may have its own wrapping parens" problem, this
# time for extent rather than head).
#
# This mixin sits BEFORE LambdaTransformer in MRO, so its super() calls reach
# Transformer's real dispatch, which looks up handlers via getattr(self, ...)
# — INSTANCE attributes (the setattr'd registry handlers) are found exactly as
# for a plain LambdaTransformer instance; only the dispatch hooks below differ.

#: rule_alias -> the exact glyph text for every "binary, single occurrence,
#: filtered-anonymous-literal" operator this transform locates via
#: spans.find_glyph: the classical infix comparisons and the arithmetic term
#: operators (neither driven by the OPERATORS registry, which only covers
#: FORMULA operators, not the term layer's infix predicates/functions) plus
#: the two binary connective levels (→, ↔ — these ARE registry-driven; see
#: _binary_glyph below, which merges this with the registry so both paths
#: share one lookup). The arithmetic entries give a Function("+"/"-"/"*"/"/",

        not just the outermost one Lark itself dispatches (see the module

        operands' own (already-known) inner extents — safe even when an
        operand carries its own redundant wrapping parens, same reasoning as
        find_glyph's docstring.

        Each intermediate's EXTENT is NOT the naive union of its two
        operands' inner extents — an operand's inner extent deliberately
        excludes redundant wrapping parens (A5 item 3), so if operand k is

        THROUGH that closing paren and the next operand's opening paren,
        producing a non-reparseable fragment (e.g. "(P) ∧ (Q)" would wrongly
        shrink to "P) ∧ (Q"). Instead every intermediate STARTS at the whole
        fold's own start (meta.start_pos — exactly operand 0's true outer
        bound, parens included, since operand 0 begins the rule's own match)
        and ENDS either at the position right before the NEXT connective
        (whitespace-trimmed backward — exactly operand k's true outer bound)
        for a non-final intermediate, or at the whole fold's own end
        (meta.end_pos) for the final one — both of which correctly include
        any wrapping parens an operand happens to have, because they are
        read off the ACTUAL SOURCE TEXT / the whole rule's own Lark-computed

        fuzzy: if True, use Łukasiewicz operators (⊗ ⊕ for strong
            conjunction/disjunction; ¬ → ↔ map to Łukasiewicz nodes). Combines
            with ``many_sorted``, ``modal``, ``second_order`` and

            and, of the other flags, the operators that are no connective (the
            modal family, the predicate quantifier, a predicate in argument

            cardinality terms have a two-valued reading and are in no fuzzy
            mode.
        modal: if True, parse FOL extended with modal, epistemic, doxastic,
            temporal, and deontic operators (□ ◇ K_a B_a Ⓖ Ⓕ Ⓝ Ⓤ Ⓞ Ⓟ) over
            classical unsorted quantifiers/constants, or — combined with

            binder then requires a sort annotation, exactly like plain
            MSFOL: ``□∀x:Human (Mortal(x))``). Combines with ``second_order``,
            ``third_order`` and ``fuzzy``.
        second_order: if True, parse classical FOL extended with
            second-order quantifiers over predicate variables (∀P / ∃P, where P
            is an uppercase PREDICATE; the bound predicate's arity is inferred
            from its applications in the body) over classical unsorted
            individual quantifiers/constants, or — combined with

            itself stays unsorted; only the ∀x/∃x individual binders and bare
            constants need a sort). Combines with ``modal=True`` (second-order

        third_order: if True, parse second-order syntax extended with predicates
            in ARGUMENT position — ``Positive(G)``, ``Essence(G, x)``,

            ontological argument is stated in) and with ``many_sorted=True``
            (the individual binders and constants carry sorts; a property and a
            predicate quantifier stay unsorted) and with ``fuzzy=True``; not
            with ``second_order`` (which it contains).
        dependence: if True, parse the team-semantic dependence/IF fragment —
            literals, ∧, splitting ∨, ∀/∃, dependence atoms ``=(x, y)``, and
            slashed existentials ``∃y/{x} φ``. Standalone (no other flag).
        linear: if True, parse propositional intuitionistic linear logic —
            ``⊗ & ⊕ ⊸ ! 𝟙`` over atomic propositions. Standalone.
        lambek: if True, parse Lambek-calculus category types — ``• \\ /`` over
            atomic categories (``NP``, ``S``, …). Standalone.

    The classical modes are the twelve combinations of three independent
    choices: the order (first, ``second_order``, ``third_order``), ``modal``, and
    ``many_sorted``. A sort is a property of an INDIVIDUAL binder or constant in
    every one of them: ``∀x:S`` ranges over the sort ``S``, while ``∀P`` and a
    property argument range over the relations on the whole domain. So the
    third-order typing of a slot (an individual, or a property of some arity)
    is the same with and without sorts.

    ``fuzzy=True`` next to the same three choices gives twelve more modes, FL
    and MSFL among them, named by the classical mode with ``fl`` before it
    (``flmodal``, ``flso_sorted``, ``fltomodal`` …). A fuzzy mode is the
    classical mode of the same choices with the Łukasiewicz connectives in
    place of the two-valued ones, and without the counting forms.

        The model MSFLParser publishes is a two-way split: NamingError for a
        lexer-level failure, ParsingError for a structurally incomplete
        formula. Under Earley's dynamic lexer that split fell out of lark's own
        exception types, because the lexer only ever offers tokens the parser
        can currently use -- a well-formed symbol in the wrong place never
        became a token at all, it stayed an unscannable character. A table
        lexer has no such scruples: it tokenises first and the parser refuses
        afterwards, so the SAME input arrives here as UnexpectedToken.

        For a hybrid mode whose Earley FALLBACK is the one that raised this
        (``_from_earley_fallback``), no translation applies at all: that
        exception already carries Earley's own semantics (see
        ``_parse_tree``), so it is reported exactly as the old, pre-wrapper,
        pure-Earley modal parser would have.

        The translation below is not a guess. Measured over the 1310-line FOLIO
        fixture plus hand-written malformed shapes, the two parsers' failures
        line up exactly, with no overlap in either direction:

            Earley UnexpectedCharacters  ->  LALR UnexpectedToken, token != $END
            Earley UnexpectedEOF         ->  LALR UnexpectedToken, token == $END

        So $END means "the formula ended too early" (ParsingError) and anything
        else means "this does not belong here" (NamingError), reported against
        the offending token's FIRST CHARACTER and position -- which is the
        character Earley used to name, on a real lark.UnexpectedCharacters so
        that the UnexpectedInput API NamingError inherits (match_examples()
        above all) keeps working. Of the 58 inputs rejected in fol mode, 26
        messages come out byte-identical; the 32 that differ are all
        "Incomplete formula ...
        Expected: ...", where LALR knows the answer more precisely and stops
        leaking an internal ``__ANON_5`` terminal name into user-facing text.

        Earley parsers keep the old routing: their UnexpectedToken means
        something else, and this mapping is calibrated for LALR only.
