r"""The OWL corpus harness: how much of a real ontology this kit can take.

Opt-in and skipped by default. The kit holds tools, not corpora, so the Open
Energy Ontology is never committed; point ``$UFK_OEO_AXIOMS_JSONL`` at a local
per-axiom record file and these tests run against it, following the convention
the kit's four other access-gated corpora already use (``UFK_FRACAS_XML``,
``UFK_PFOLIO_CSV``/``UFK_FOLIO_CSV``, ``UFK_PMB_SBN_DIR``, ``UFK_LEO3``): one
``UFK_*`` variable, read at module level, with the ``skipif`` marker in this
module rather than in a shared conftest.

The record file is JSON Lines, one object per axiom. Only three fields are
read: ``owlfs`` (the axiom's OWL 2 Functional-Style Syntax text — the INPUT),
and ``needs``/``kind`` (census keys). The records also carry a ``fol`` field;
it is deliberately NOT used as a gold image, because the copy this harness was
written against was measured on 0.28.1 and carries the pre-0.30.0 ``x_1``
variable shape. Expected images belong in a test file, hand-derived — see
``tests/test_owl_constructs_fixture.py``, which is the committed stand-in that
covers every construct in the default suite.

Why a JSONL of axioms as well as the ``.owl`` file: the per-axiom record file
is where the ``needs`` census keys live, which is what makes a per-construct
floor possible instead of one opaque total. OEO ships as RDF/XML, which
``dl.parse_owl_rdfxml`` reads; point ``$UFK_OEO_OWL`` at ``oeo-full.owl`` and
the last two tests read it, and with both variables set they check that the
RDF/XML file and the record file are one knowledge base (the record file was
written by the requesting project's own reader, from rdflib's triples, so the
two readings are independent).

What is asserted is a FLOOR per construct family, never an exact total: an OEO
point release shifts the counts, and a test that breaks on someone else's
release is a test nobody keeps. The breakdown is PRINTED (run with ``-s``), so
the next package can watch its own number move.

Deliberately NOT here: the tableau. Pushing 3091 GCIs through
``concept_satisfiable`` is a benchmark, not a test; the route agreement is
checked on hand-built knowledge bases in ``tests/test_dl_route_agreement.py``.

# The ceiling on REFUSALS per construct family, measured on OEO 2.13.0 (4041
# axioms) with 0.30.0 and again after the data layer — equivalently, the floor
# on acceptance, which is what this harness exists to raise. Each number is how many axioms whose `needs`
# field names that construct are still refused today, so the package that
# implements the construct drives its entry to 0 and nothing else moves. A
# CEILING rather than an exact total so that a later OEO release adding axioms
# of an already-supported kind does not break the suite; a release adding
# axioms of a REFUSED kind does, which is the right way round — that is new
# work, not a passing test.
#
# `TopObjectProperty` is the odd one, and it is worth recording WHY it does not
# move with the role box. The kit now consumes a tautological inclusion into an
# OWL 2 built-in property as a documented no-op, in both W3C spellings
# (`owl:topObjectProperty` and the full `http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#...`
# IRI) -- and the full IRI is what oeo-full.owl itself carries, 36 times. But
# this record file's own `owlfs` text has already replaced that IRI with the
# requesting project's CamelCase SYMBOL, `TopObjectProperty`, which is not an
# OWL built-in spelling at all: so feeding this text to the kit legitimately
# builds an inclusion into an ordinary role of that name, and the 31 axioms
# stay "accepted" exactly as before. That is a lossiness in the record file,
# not in the kit; a harness that wants to observe the no-op must feed the
# built-in's real IRI. The reading itself is pinned by hand in
# tests/test_owl_constructs_fixture.py and tests/test_owl_functional.py.
#
# A ceiling of 0 means the construct is fully supported: the entry stays, so a
# later OEO release re-introducing an axiom the kit has stopped reading fails
# here rather than passing quietly.
