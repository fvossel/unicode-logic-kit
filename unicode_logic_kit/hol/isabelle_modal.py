r"""Isabelle/HOL shallow semantical embedding (SSE) of quantified modal logic.

This module *emits* a complete, loadable Isabelle/HOL theory (``theory NAME
imports Main begin ... end``) that shallow-embeds a modal formula in the
Benzmüller style and states it as a **real** ``lemma`` (not a comment). It is the
faithful Isabelle counterpart of the THF export
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml.to_thf_modal` and is kept consistent with the
ground-truth Kripke evaluator
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal`.

What it covers
--------------
The full modal family handled by the AST:

- **alethic** ``Box`` □ / ``Diamond`` ◇ over an accessibility relation ``r``;
- **epistemic** ``Knows`` and **doxastic** ``Believes`` over **agent-indexed**
  relations ``rk`` / ``rb`` of type ``'a \<Rightarrow> i \<Rightarrow> i \<Rightarrow> bool`` — the
  agent is a first-class *term* (``Variable`` or ``Constant``), so a bound object
  variable in agent position (``∀x (Student(x) → K_x φ)``) quantifies over agents,
  exactly as in :func:`satisfies_modal`;
- **deontic** ``Obligatory`` / ``Permitted`` over a (serial) relation ``d``;
- **temporal** ``Always`` / ``Eventually`` over the henceforth relation ``t`` and
  ``Next`` over the one-step relation ``n``, plus the binary interval operators
  ``Until`` / ``Since`` as inductive least fixpoints over ``n`` (see below).

The embedding is **faithful to** :func:`satisfies_modal` on the overlapping
fragment: every modality is read as a box/diamond over the corresponding
relation and object quantifiers are ``existsAt``-guarded (actualist).

Identity is **rigid** (see "Equality" below), matching
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml.qml_is_valid`.

Equality
--------
An identity atom ``t₁ = t₂`` is Isabelle's own polymorphic ``=`` over the entity
type ``e``, lifted with a world binder that is never used —
``(\<lambda>_. t₁ = t₂)`` — so it takes **no world argument** and cannot vary by
world. ``t₁ ≠ t₂`` is lowered to ``¬(t₁ = t₂)`` first, exactly as
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml.qml_translate` does (the lowering is
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml._st_equality` itself, imported rather than
copied). Consequences, each one a theorem of the emitted theory and the same
verdict ``qml_is_valid`` gives: ``a = a``, ``a = b → b = a``, transitivity, the
necessity of identity ``a = b → □(a = b)`` and of distinctness
``a ≠ b → □(a ≠ b)`` (valid in every frame, under every ``mode``),
``◇(a = b) → a = b``, and Leibniz's law ``a = b → (P(a) ↔ P(b))`` /
``a = b → (□P(a) ↔ □P(b))`` and congruence over function symbols.
``□(a = b) → a = b`` is **not** valid in ``K`` (a dead-end world makes the box
vacuously true) and is valid exactly when the frame guarantees a
successor-or-self (``T``, ``S4``, ``S5``, ``KD``, ``KD45``).

Identity ranges over the whole entity type ``e`` and is **not** existence-guarded
under a varying domain (``qml``'s documented choice): ``a = a`` holds at a world
where ``a`` does not exist, and ``∃x (x = c)`` — which *does* go through the
``existsAt``-guarded ``mexists`` — is valid under ``constant`` / ``possibilist``
and not under the actualist modes. The ordering atoms ``<`` ``>`` ``≤`` ``≥`` are
still ordinary uninterpreted world-relativized predicates (``flt`` …), as in
``qml``. An ``=`` / ``≠`` atom that is not binary raises ``ValueError``, again as
in ``qml``.

Temporal caveat (henceforth / transitive closure)
-------------------------------------------------
``satisfies_modal`` reads ``Always``/``Eventually`` over the **reflexive-transitive
closure** of the one-step ``"temporal"`` relation, whereas a plain shallow
abbreviation can only quantify over the relation it is given. This module emits
the **box/diamond-over-``t`` reading** and, when ``temporal_closure=True`` (the
default), additionally constrains ``t`` to be a *reflexive + transitive* relation
via frame axioms, so ``t`` denotes the henceforth relation directly and the
embedding matches the closure semantics. ``Next`` is the genuine one-step box over
the one-step successor relation ``n``. In ``satisfies_modal`` ``Always`` /
``Eventually`` close over the **same** one-step ``"temporal"`` relation that
``Next`` reads, so every one-step successor is henceforth-reachable and
``Always(P) → Next(P)`` is valid. To keep the embedding faithful, when ``Next``
co-occurs with ``Always`` / ``Eventually`` (both ``n`` and ``t`` declared) this
module emits the linking axiom ``n_in_t : "⋀w v. n w v ⟹ t w v"`` (one-step
successor ⟹ henceforth-reachable), so ``Always(P) → Next(P)`` is likewise a
theorem of the emitted theory.

Binary interval operators ``Until`` / ``Since``
-----------------------------------------------
``Until`` and ``Since`` are emitted as **inductive least-fixpoint predicates**
``muntil`` / ``msince`` over the one-step relation ``n`` (not as box/diamond
abbreviations). ``muntil phi psi`` is the least predicate closed under
``psi w ⟹ muntil w`` and ``phi w ∧ n w v ∧ muntil v ⟹ muntil w``, so it denotes
exactly the **finite forward ``n``-paths** with ``psi`` at the endpoint and
``phi`` at every earlier point — the faithful counterpart of the depth-first path
search in :func:`satisfies_modal` (``_until_holds``); ``msince`` is the backward
mirror over the converse of ``n`` (``_since_holds``). A plain interval reading over
the closure ``t`` would *not* be faithful on branching / short-cut frames (it asks
``phi`` at every ``t``-intermediate world, the path search only along one path); the
least fixpoint is faithful on **every** frame. Because these read the one-step
relation ``n``, using ``Until`` / ``Since`` declares ``n`` (as ``Next`` does) and,
when ``Always`` / ``Eventually`` also occur, links ``n`` into the henceforth ``t``
so the two agree. The Isabelle-verified characterization (the strong-Until /
Since fixpoint equation and reachability) lives in ``tests/test_hol_isabelle_modal``
and the live ``check_theory`` gate.

Cross-family bridges (``bridges=``)
-----------------------------------
``frame=`` and ``systems=`` each constrain exactly **one** relation. A *bridge*
relates **two** relations belonging to different modal families, which is why it
is a separate, **opt-in** option and not another ``systems=`` entry. Three are
available (see :data:`BRIDGES`):

======================================  ====================  ==========================
name                                    schema                exact frame correspondent
======================================  ====================  ==========================
``knowledge_implies_belief``            ``K_a φ → B_a φ``     ``rb ⊆ rk``
``sincerity``                           ``Say_a φ → B_a φ``   ``rb ⊆ rs``
``ought_implies_can``                   ``Oφ → ◇φ``           ``∀w. ∃v. d w v ∧ r w v``
======================================  ====================  ==========================

Each condition is the **exact** correspondent of its schema — necessary as well
as sufficient — established by brute force over every frame on ≤ 2 worlds against
:func:`satisfies_modal`, not quoted from the literature. In particular
``ought_implies_can`` is deliberately **not** the frequently quoted inclusion
``d ⊆ r``: measured, ``d ⊆ r`` alone does not validate ``Oφ → ◇φ`` at all (a world
with no ``d``-successor makes ``Oφ`` vacuously true while ``◇φ`` is false), and
``d ⊆ r`` *together with* ``d``-seriality validates the strictly stronger
``□φ → Oφ`` ("whatever is necessary is obligatory") that the caller never asked
for. The emitted "meet" condition subsumes ``d``-seriality and does *not*
validate ``□φ → Oφ``. ``d_serial`` is still emitted alongside it — redundant but
harmless, and dropping it would change :func:`modal_axiom_names`' documented
output.

Bridges are OFF by default. A bridge whose partner family does not occur in the
formula **raises** ``ValueError``: silently skipping it would emit a weaker logic
than requested, and declaring the missing relation anyway is not conservative
(``d_meets_r`` entails seriality of the alethic ``r``, measurably turning
``□P → ◇P`` from invalid into valid under ``frame='K'``). See
:func:`_bridge_axioms` for the full argument.

Honesty
-------
The toolkit *emits* a theory; it does **not** run Isabelle, Sledgehammer, or any
prover. First-order modal logic, like FOL, is **undecidable but semi-decidable**
(validity is recursively enumerable; full second-order logic is *not even
semi-decidable*), so a successful emission means "here is a sound problem an
external prover *may* discharge", never "the formula is decided". Propositional
modal K/T/S4/S5 *are* decidable, but this emitter does not itself decide them.
The default proof tactic is a Sledgehammer hook followed by an ``oops`` fallback
so the emitted theory always loads even when no automatic proof is found.

# Cross-family bridge axioms (opt-in, ``bridges=``).
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# WHY A SEPARATE OPTION. ``frame=`` constrains the alethic r and ``systems=``
# constrains ONE agent-indexed relation each; both are single-relation frame
# properties. A bridge is a principle relating TWO relations of DIFFERENT modal
# families (knowledge to belief, assertion to belief, obligation to possibility),
# so it cannot be phrased as a ``systems=`` entry — hence its own opt-in option,
# defaulting to off.
#
# WHY THESE CONDITIONS. Each condition below is the EXACT frame correspondent of
# its schema — necessary as well as sufficient — measured by brute force over
# every frame on <= 2 worlds against semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal, not quoted
# from the literature:
#
#   rb subset rk        |= K_a phi -> B_a phi     and rb subset rk does NOT
#                                                 validate B_a phi -> K_a phi,
#                                                 while no condition at all fails
#                                                 to validate K -> B.
#   rb subset rs        |= Say_a phi -> B_a phi   (same two-sided check)
#   d meets r           |= O phi -> <>phi
#
# THE ``d subset r`` TRAP — do NOT "simplify" d_meets_r into an inclusion. The
# frequently quoted ought-implies-can condition ``d subset r`` is measurably the
# WRONG axiom: on its own it does not validate O phi -> <>phi at all (a world with
# no d-successor makes O phi vacuously true while <>phi is false), and ``d subset
# r`` TOGETHER WITH d-seriality validates the strictly stronger [] phi -> O phi
# ("whatever is necessary is obligatory"), which the caller never requested. The
# existential "meet" condition emitted here is exactly right: it subsumes
# d-seriality (every world gets a d-successor) and does not validate [] phi -> O
# phi. ``d_serial`` is still emitted alongside it whenever the deontic family
# occurs — redundant but harmless, and suppressing it would change the documented
# output of :func:`modal_axiom_names`.
#
# ALL ROUTES AGREE, and that is asserted rather than assumed. The guarded
# first-order route ``fol.qml`` emits the same three conditions under the same three
# names, including this meet condition for ``ought_implies_can`` (it realised that
# one as the inclusion ``D subset R`` in an earlier draft, which validated the
# unrequested ``[] phi -> O phi`` and ``P phi -> <>phi``). ``fol.QML_BRIDGES`` and
# ``hol.BRIDGES`` stay SEPARATE registries — ``fol`` must not import ``hol`` — so
# tests/test_hol_bridges.py and tests/test_qml_bridges.py cross-check the two tables
# against each other and against the Kripke oracle, rather than trusting either.
#
# WHY THE VARIABLES ARE BOUND EXPLICITLY (\<And>a w v. ...) rather than left free
# and schematic like _frame_axioms / _AGENT_CONDS. A free variable in an
# axiomatization is generalised ONLY if the name is not already a declared
# constant. The agent slot is the dangerous one: an agent named ``a`` (the
# canonical test agent) emits ``consts a :: "e"``, and a free ``a`` in the axiom
# then resolves to THAT CONSTANT and typechecks, so the inclusion would silently
# hold for one agent instead of all — a weaker logic than requested, with no
# error. A Pure binder shadows the constant inside its scope, so the schema is
# universal whatever the formula's symbols are named. (The pre-existing
# _AGENT_CONDS schemas have the same exposure; changing them is a separate
# change, since their emitted text is pinned by existing tests.)

    Each bridge adds ONE frame condition relating two relations of different
    modal families; the emitted axiom is the exact correspondent of the schema
    the option is named after (``knowledge_implies_belief`` → ``rb ⊆ rk``,
    ``sincerity`` → ``rb ⊆ rs``, ``ought_implies_can`` → ``∀w. ∃v. d w v ∧ r w v``
    — never the folklore ``d ⊆ r``, see the section comment above). Emission
    follows :data:`_BRIDGES` order, not the caller's set-iteration order, so the
    output is deterministic.

    Honest contract — what a request for a bridge whose partner family does NOT
    occur in the formula does, and why. Such a bridge names a relation that this
    emitter never declares (every relation block is conditional on its operators
    occurring), so the axiom would not even load. There are three possible
    policies and only one of them is honest:

    - *silently skip it*: the caller asked for a logic and would receive a
      strictly WEAKER one with no signal — the exact "silently weakened logic"
      failure this module refuses everywhere else;
    - *declare the relation anyway*: not uniformly conservative, and it fails in
      the STRENGTHENING direction. Measured: ``d_meets_r`` entails
      ``∃v. r w v``, i.e. seriality of the ALETHIC relation, so emitting
      ``ought_implies_can`` for a formula with no ``O``/``P`` but with ``□``/``◇``
      would turn ``□P → ◇P`` from invalid into valid under ``frame='K'`` — a
      silent change to the alethic logic the caller *did* select. (The two
      inclusion bridges happen to be conservative when their partner family is
      absent, but a rule that sometimes emits and sometimes refuses depending on
      the axiom's shape is not predictable from the option name.)
    - *raise*: one uniform rule for every bridge, present and future; the repo's
      established idiom for "this cannot be expressed here as asked" (see the GL
      guard in ``fol.qml.qml_axioms`` and :func:`_agent_system_axioms`); and the
      only policy under which the relation-declaration blocks stay untouched, so
      a bridge is emitted exactly when both relation blocks already are.

    ``ValueError`` — not ``NotImplementedError`` — because the route *can* express
    the bridge; the caller's formula simply does not mention one of the families.
    ``NotImplementedError`` stays reserved for "this route cannot express it".

      ``'a \\<Rightarrow> i \\<Rightarrow> i \\<Rightarrow> bool``; deontic ``d``; temporal henceforth ``t`` and

      agent-indexed ``knows`` / ``believes``, ``obl`` / ``perm``, ``malways`` /
      ``meventually`` / ``mnext``, the ``existsAt``-guarded ``mforall`` / ``mexists``,
      and ``mvalid``) as Isabelle abbreviations;
    - emits the frame axioms for ``frame`` (K/T/S4/S5/KD/KD45), the domain-regime
      axioms for ``mode``, and (when ``temporal_closure``) the refl+trans axioms on
      the temporal relation ``t`` so it denotes the henceforth (closure) relation,
      faithfully to :func:`satisfies_modal`;
    - states the formula as a **real** ``lemma "\\<lfloor> ... \\<rfloor>"`` whose body is the
      *lifted* embedding (not a ``to_unicode_str`` dump in a comment), followed by
      the proof text for ``tactic``;
    - for a many-sorted formula, states that every sort the formula uses is
      non-empty (``nonempty_sort<i>``) and that every sorted constant ``c:S`` is an
      element of ``S`` at EVERY world (``sort_member<i>``: ``S c w``, unguarded by
      ``existsAt``, because a constant is rigid and may lie outside the domain of a
      world). A sort that occurs only through a sorted constant gets its guard
      declared too. A formula without a sorted constant gets no ``sort_member`` line
      and its text is unchanged.

    Args:
        formula: the modal AST node to embed.
        mode: object-quantifier domain regime — ``constant`` / ``possibilist`` or
            ``varying`` / ``increasing`` / ``cumulative`` / ``decreasing``.
        frame: alethic frame system in {K, T, S4, S5, KD, KD45}.
        tactic: a key of :data:`ISABELLE_TACTICS`. The default ``"sledgehammer"``
            emits a Sledgehammer hook plus ``oops`` so the theory loads without
            claiming a proof; ``"metis"`` / ``"auto"`` / ``"blast"`` / ``"smt"`` emit a
            ``by ...`` proof. For these ``by``-style tactics the proof is prefixed
            with ``using <frame/domain axioms>`` so an axiom-dependent validity
            (T/S4/S5/KD/KD45, temporal closure, domain regime) can actually
            discharge — a bare ``axiomatization`` fact is not in the default claset.
            ``"sorry"`` admits the goal.
        theory_name: the Isabelle theory name (must match the .thy filename).
        proof: an explicit proof block to emit verbatim in place of the ``tactic``
            preset (used by the Isabelle runner to splice in a prove-battery or a
            ``nitpick`` invocation). When ``None`` the ``tactic`` preset is used.
        temporal_closure: when True, constrain ``t`` to be reflexive+transitive so
            ``Always`` / ``Eventually`` denote the henceforth (refl-trans-closure)
            reading of :func:`satisfies_modal`. ``Next`` always uses the one-step
            relation ``n`` regardless.
        systems: optional per-family frame systems for the AGENT-INDEXED relations,
            e.g. ``{"epistemic": "S5", "doxastic": "KD45"}`` (families:
            ``epistemic`` rk, ``doxastic`` rb, ``assertive`` rs, ``bouletic`` rw;
            values from {K, T, B, S4, S5, KD, KD45}). Each axiom leaves the agent
            schematic, so the property holds per agent — mirroring
            ``to_thf_modal_full``'s parameter of the same name. A family whose
            operators do not occur in the formula is skipped.
        bridges: optional collection of CROSS-family bridge names (see
            :data:`BRIDGES`), **off by default**:

            - ``"knowledge_implies_belief"`` — schema ``K_a φ → B_a φ``, frame
              correspondent ``rb ⊆ rk`` (axiom ``rb_in_rk``);
            - ``"sincerity"`` — schema ``Say_a φ → B_a φ``, correspondent
              ``rb ⊆ rs`` (axiom ``rb_in_rs``);
            - ``"ought_implies_can"`` — schema ``Oφ → ◇φ``, correspondent
              ``∀w. ∃v. d w v ∧ r w v`` (axiom ``d_meets_r``). Deliberately NOT
              the folklore ``d ⊆ r``, which measurably fails to validate
              ``Oφ → ◇φ`` on its own and, with seriality, over-validates
              ``□φ → Oφ``.

            Each condition is the exact correspondent of its schema, so the
            bridge adds precisely that principle and nothing stronger. Requesting
            a bridge whose partner family does not occur in the formula raises
            ``ValueError`` (its relation is never declared; skipping would emit a
            weaker logic and declaring it anyway is not conservative) — see
            :func:`_bridge_axioms`.

    Returns:
        The theory text (newline-terminated).

    Note:
        The toolkit only *emits* this theory — it does not run Isabelle or
        Sledgehammer. First-order modal logic is undecidable, so emission proves
        nothing; an external prover must discharge the lemma.
