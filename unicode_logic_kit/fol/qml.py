"""Quantified modal logic via a first-order shallow embedding (Benzmüller-style, FO).

This is the *first-order fragment* of the shallow semantical embedding (SSE): a modal
formula over an explicit "current world" is translated into classical first-order
logic, so the existing back-ends (Z3, the resolution prover) can decide its validity
or the equivalence of two modal formulas. Unlike the propositional
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.modal_translation.standard_translation`, this embedding
handles **object quantifiers** (`∀x` / `∃x`) under a chosen *domain regime*, so the
**Barcan** formula and its converse come out valid or invalid exactly as the regime
dictates.

Single-sorted embedding with guard predicates (worlds and individuals share one FO
sort): ``World(t)`` / ``Object(t)`` carve the two kinds apart; accessibility ``R`` is
typed World×World; existence ``E(x, w)`` ("object ``x`` exists at world ``w``") is
typed Object×World. The translation:

- ``P(t̄)`` → ``P(t̄, w)`` (the world is appended as the last argument) — for every
  predicate EXCEPT identity: ``t₁ = t₂`` → ``t₁ = t₂`` and ``t₁ ≠ t₂`` → ``¬(t₁ = t₂)``,
  with no world argument (see "Equality is rigid" below);
- ``□φ`` → ``∀v (World(v) ∧ R(w,v) → ST(φ,v))``; ``◇φ`` → ``∃v (World(v) ∧ R(w,v) ∧ ST(φ,v))``;
- **actualist** ``∀x φ`` → ``∀x (Object(x) ∧ E(x,w) → ST(φ,w))`` and dually ``∃x``;
- **constant / possibilist** ``∀x φ`` → ``∀x (Object(x) → ST(φ,w))`` (``E`` unused).

Domain regimes (the existence-axiom correspondence, verified against the Kripke
evaluator): **decreasing** ``∀x∀w∀v(E(x,v)∧R(w,v)→E(x,w))`` validates BF; **increasing**
(cumulative) ``∀x∀w∀v(E(x,w)∧R(w,v)→E(x,v))`` validates CBF; **constant** validates both;
**varying** neither.

**Equality is rigid.** An identity atom (``Atom("=", (t₁, t₂))``, what ``a = b`` parses
to; ``≠`` is its negation) is translated to the SAME binary identity over the object
terms, inside the relativised formula, with **no world argument**. So identity does not
vary by world: the necessity of identity ``a = b → □(a = b)`` and of distinctness
``a ≠ b → □(a ≠ b)`` are valid in every frame and under every domain regime, as is
``◇(a = b) → a = b``; constants and function symbols were already rigid here (``ST``
leaves terms alone), and now so is the relation between them. It is Z3's own binary
identity, so reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and congruence (hence Leibniz's law,
``a = b → (P(a) ↔ P(b))`` and ``a = b → (□P(a) ↔ □P(b))``) come from the solver, not from
an axiom: :func:`qml_axioms` has none for equality — checked, not assumed (see
``tests/test_qml.py``). Two consequences worth stating, because they are easy to misread:

- ``□(a = b) → a = b`` is **not** valid in K — a dead-end world makes the box vacuously
  true while ``a`` and ``b`` differ — and is valid in every frame that guarantees a
  successor-or-self (T, S4, S5, KD, KD45 …). Rigidity makes the converse direction
  ``a = b → □(a = b)`` free; the direction back needs the frame.
- ``a = b`` and ``¬(a = b)`` are not valid: two terms may denote the same object or two.

*Varying domains — the choice made here.* Identity ranges over the whole **object
domain** (everything typed ``Object``), not over the local domain ``D_w`` of the
world ``ST`` is at; an equality is **not** existence-guarded. So ``a = a``,
``a = b → b = a`` and ``a = b → □(a = b)`` are valid under every mode, *including* at a
world where ``a`` does not exist (a constant outside ``D_w`` still denotes, and is
still itself). That is the reading the rest of this embedding already has for atoms on
a non-existent constant — ``P(c, w)`` is left open, neither forced true (positive free
logic) nor forced false (negative free logic) — and the rigid-designator reading of
constants (``_signature_typing_facts`` types a constant ``Object``, never ``E(c, w)``).
Existence is therefore *expressed*, not presupposed, by ``∃x (x = c)``: valid under
``constant`` / ``possibilist`` (every object exists everywhere), **not** valid under
``varying`` (nor ``increasing`` / ``decreasing``), where the constant may lie outside
``D_w`` — and ``∃x (x = c) → □∃x (x = c)`` is valid exactly under the cumulative regime
(``increasing``) and ``constant``. (Here ``c`` is a CONSTANT, a multi-letter name such as
``alice`` in the kit's syntax; a single letter is a variable, and a free variable is a
parameter, which exists at the world of evaluation: see "A free variable is a
parameter" below.) The quantifier clauses, the domain axioms and the
modes themselves are unchanged. A free-logic variant in which ``c = c`` fails for a
non-existent ``c`` would be a different (negative) logic and is deliberately not
offered; guard explicitly with ``∃x (x = c) → …`` where that reading is wanted.
The propositional evaluator :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke` has no term
semantics and refuses ``=`` / ``≠`` by name instead, as do the propositional modal
tableau (:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.atp.modal_tableau`), the propositional standard
translation (:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.modal_translation`) and the intuitionistic
GMT embedding (:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.intuitionistic`) — one shared refusal, in
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.semantics._modal_reject.reject_equality`. The modal HOL
exports AGREE with this route: :func:`to_thf_modal`,
:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.thf_modal` and :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.isabelle_modal`
emit identity as the host logic's own ``=`` over the individual sort with no world
argument. So on equality a formula has exactly two fates in this kit: rigid
identity, or a refusal that names the atom.

**A free variable is a parameter.** A variable that is free in a formula names ONE unknown
individual of the object domain, the same everywhere in the formula (the assignment-wise
consequence relation of the textbooks), and it is rigid, like a constant: the same
individual at every world. Which individuals it may be depends on the domain regime. Under
``constant`` / ``possibilist`` every individual exists at every world, so the parameter is
typed ``Object(y)`` like a constant and ``∀x P(x) → P(y)`` and ``P(y) → ∃x P(x)`` are
valid. Under ``varying`` / ``increasing`` / ``decreasing`` the parameter exists at the world
of evaluation, which the validity query states as ``E(y, w)`` (the existence guard the
free-logic route gives its parameters), and nowhere else is it required to exist. So
``∀x P(x) → P(y)``, ``P(y) → ∃x P(x)`` and ``∃x (x = y)`` are valid in every regime, while
``□∀x P(x) → □P(y)`` and ``□∃x (x = y)`` are valid under ``constant`` / ``possibilist`` and
``increasing`` only: the individual may be missing from a later world of a ``varying`` or a
``decreasing`` model, and then the later world's quantifier does not reach it. A CONSTANT
is different (see "Equality is rigid"): it may lie outside the domain of the world it is
read at, so ``∃x (x = alice)`` is valid only under ``constant`` / ``possibilist``. Use a
constant for that reading, or state the existence of the individual in the formula. For a
formula with no premise the parameter reading is the universal closure of the formula
(under a varying regime: of the formula guarded by the existence of its parameters).
``P(y) → P(alice)`` and ``(P(y) ∧ Q(z)) → ∀x (P(x) ∧ Q(x))`` are not valid in any regime.
:func:`qml_translate` leaves a free variable alone; the typing and the guard are part of
the validity query (:func:`qml_validity_formula`), which :func:`qml_is_valid` and
:func:`qml_equivalent` decide.

**One relation per modal family.** ``R`` is alethic (``□`` / ``◇``, configured by
``frame=``), ``T`` is the temporal *henceforth* relation (``Always`` / ``Eventually``
read it forward, ``Historically`` / ``Once`` read its converse), ``N`` is the *one-step
successor* (``Next``, and ``Previous`` over its converse) and ``D`` is deontic
(``Obligatory`` / ``Permitted``); the agent-indexed families use the ternary ``Rk`` /
``Rb`` / ``Rs`` / ``Rw`` (configured by ``systems=``). :func:`qml_axioms` types every
relation the formula actually uses and, for ``T`` / ``N`` / ``D``, asserts these
**default-on** frame conditions — chosen so this route agrees with
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal` and with the HOL routes, whose
``t_refl`` / ``t_trans`` / ``n_in_t`` / ``d_serial`` are the same conditions
(:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.isabelle_modal`, :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.thf_modal`):

- ``T`` reflexive + transitive, ``N ⊆ T``, and — when both relations occur — the
  ``first_step`` axiom below, the first-order shadow of the HOL routes' ``t_in_nstar``.
  So ``Gφ → φ``, ``Gφ → GGφ``, ``Gφ → Fφ``, ``Gφ → Xφ``, ``φ → Fφ``, the fixpoint
  unfolding ``(φ ∧ XGφ) → Gφ`` and the past mirrors ``Hφ → φ``, ``Hφ → HHφ``,
  ``Hφ → Yφ``, ``φ → Once φ`` are valid, while ``Xφ → φ``, ``φ → Gφ``, ``Fφ → Gφ``,
  ``Gφ → Hφ`` and ``Xφ → Fφ`` correctly stay invalid.
- ``D`` serial (Standard Deontic Logic, KD), the reading the ``Obligatory`` / ``Permitted``
  node docstrings already declare. ``Oφ → Pφ`` and ``Oφ → ¬O¬φ`` become valid; ``Oφ → φ``
  stays invalid. Honest contract: a ``True`` verdict for a deontic formula therefore means
  "valid over every **serial-deontic** model". ``satisfies_modal`` enforces no seriality of
  its own, so a hand-built dead-end deontic model still refutes ``Oφ → Pφ`` *there*.

**The transitive-closure limit — what stays out of reach.** ``satisfies_modal`` evaluates
``Always`` / ``Eventually`` over the reflexive-transitive CLOSURE ``N*`` of the one-step
relation, i.e. the *intended* constraint is ``T = N*``. Reflexivity, transitivity and
``N ⊆ T`` axiomatise the half ``T ⊇ N*`` (``N*`` is by definition the least refl-trans
relation containing ``N``), which is what makes the list above sound. The converse half
``T ⊆ N*`` is **not** first-order definable — the same obstacle this module already
reports for ``Until`` / ``Since`` — because it demands that the witnessing path be
*finite*. A first-order CONSEQUENCE of it is definable, however, and this route asserts it
whenever ``T`` and ``N`` both occur (``first_step``, see
:func:`_temporal_first_step_axiom`)::

    ∀w ∀v (World(w) ∧ World(v) ∧ T(w,v) → w = v ∨ ∃u (World(u) ∧ N(w,u) ∧ T(u,v)))

— "a henceforth-step is either standing still or one step followed by a henceforth-step".
Every ``T = N*`` model satisfies it, so it over-validates nothing, and with it the ``←``
direction of the fixpoint unfolding ``(φ ∧ XGφ) → Gφ`` becomes provable here (the ``→``
direction needs only ``T ⊇ N*``). Temporal induction ``(φ ∧ G(φ → Xφ)) → Gφ`` genuinely
does stay out of reach — measured: ``first_step`` does not close it — because reaching an
arbitrary ``T``-successor from the first step needs induction over the closure, which no
first-order theory states. For that one use the higher-order routes
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.isabelle_modal.to_isabelle_modal` /
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.isabelle_runner.isabelle_decide_modal`, whose ``t_in_nstar``
axiom pins ``t`` to ``rtranclp n``. The honest summary of this route's temporal strength
is therefore "refl + trans + ``N ⊆ T`` + ``first_step``" — a chosen axiom set, not "the
limit of first-order logic".

**Cross-family bridges** relate two families' relations and are **opt-in**: none is
emitted by default, because none of them is forced by ``satisfies_modal``. Pass
``bridges=["knowledge_implies_belief", ...]``; the table is :data:`QML_BRIDGES`, an
unknown name raises ``ValueError`` listing the known ones, and so does a bridge whose
partner family the formula never mentions. Each condition is the exact frame correspondent
of its schema and is **the same condition the HOL routes emit under the same name** —
inclusions ``Rb ⊆ Rk`` / ``Rb ⊆ Rs`` for the two agent-indexed bridges, and the meet
condition ``∀w ∃v (D(w,v) ∧ R(w,v))`` (``d_meets_r``) for ``ought_implies_can``, which is
deliberately NOT the folklore ``D ⊆ R``: see :func:`_bridge_axiom` for the measured
witnesses showing that the inclusion validates the unrequested ``□φ → Oφ`` and
``Pφ → ◇φ`` while the meet condition validates ``Oφ → ◇φ`` and neither artefact.

Validity is ``AX → ∀w (World(w) → ST(φ, w))``, checked with Z3. First-order modal logic
is undecidable, so this is **sound but bounded-incomplete** (Z3 may not close every
valid instance) — the model-theoretic partner is
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal` with per-world ``domains``.

**Many-sorted formulas** (``SortedQuantifier``, ``∀x:S φ`` / ``∃x:S φ``) are handled by
relativizing the WHOLE input formula once, at :func:`qml_translate`'s entry, into the
guarded plain FOL ``fol.to_fol`` also builds (``∀x:S φ`` → ``∀x (S(x) → φ)``, ``∃x:S φ``
→ ``∃x (S(x) ∧ φ)``) — before anything scans or translates it, so a ``SortedConstant``
anywhere in the formula (not only directly under a ``SortedQuantifier``) is relativized
too, and :func:`_signature_typing_facts` sees the resulting plain ``Constant`` like any
other. ``ST``'s existing ``P(t̄) → P(t̄, w)`` rule then appends the world argument to the
sort guard exactly as it does to every other atom — so a sort's guard predicate
``S(x, w)`` comes out WORLD-RELATIVE (not rigid): an object can be ``S`` at one world and
not at another, the same "actualist" reading the ``E``xistence guard already gives the
object domain. :func:`qml_axioms` additionally emits, per sort the formula uses, the same
"every sort is non-empty" assumption the classical routes make
(:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.fol._msfl_nodes.nonempty_sort_axioms`) — extended PER WORLD here
(``∀w (World(w) → ∃x (Object(x) [∧ E(x,w)] ∧ S(x,w)))``) to match the world-relative guard,
mirroring the existing ``nonempty_dom`` axiom's shape — so e.g. ``∀x:S P(x) → ∃x:S P(x)``
agrees with the classical Z3 verdict at every world, not just incidentally at one.

A SORTED CONSTANT ``c:S`` denotes an element of ``S``, so :func:`qml_axioms` also emits
``∀w (World(w) → S(c, w))`` for it (read from the formula as given, where the
annotation is still there; :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.fol._msfl_nodes.sort_membership_axioms`
names the constants). A constant is a rigid designator, so the fact holds at EVERY
world, and it is not guarded by ``E(c, w)``: ``c`` may lie outside the domain of a
world, which is the reading of constants this module already has. With it
``∀x:S P(x) → P(c:S)`` is valid exactly where ``∀x P(x) → P(c)`` is (every constant
domain; no actualist mode, where ``c`` may be outside ``D_w`` and the instance is not
available), and it stays invalid with a plain ``c``, which no formula places in ``S``.

    ``"possibilist"`` (unrelativised) or ``"varying"`` / ``"increasing"`` /
    ``"decreasing"`` (actualist, guarded by the existence predicate ``E``).

    If ``world`` clashes with an object variable the formula binds, a fresh world name
    is substituted to prevent that quantifier from capturing the world parameter.

    A variable that is free in ``formula`` stays free in the image, as the parameter it
    is. What the translation does not state is its typing (an element of the object
    domain) or, under a varying regime, its existence at ``world``: those are facts of the
    validity query, :func:`qml_validity_formula`. See the module docstring's "A free
    variable is a parameter".

    An identity atom is the one atom that does NOT get the world appended: ``t₁ = t₂``
    stays ``t₁ = t₂`` and ``t₁ ≠ t₂`` becomes ``¬(t₁ = t₂)``, so identity is rigid (see
    the module docstring's "Equality is rigid", which also states the varying-domain
    choice). A non-binary ``=`` / ``≠`` atom raises ``ValueError`` rather than being
    read as a world-relative predicate.

    A many-sorted ``formula`` (``SortedQuantifier`` / ``SortedConstant``) is relativized
    ONCE, here, before anything else runs — see the module docstring's "Many-sorted
    formulas" section for what that does and does not assume. The relativisation forgets
    which constants were annotated, so the membership of a sorted constant in its sort is
    NOT part of this translation: it is an axiom, which :func:`qml_axioms` emits from the
    formula as given.

    A node the classical layer defines by other nodes is read by that definition, the one
    :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.fol.nodes.to_fol` applies: a counting quantifier ``∃≥n`` /
    ``∃≤n`` / ``∃=n`` (sorted or not) by its distinct witnesses, which are object

    The ``w = v`` disjunct is genuine identity: at this level ``Atom("=", [w, v])``
    lowers to Z3's own equality (``Node.to_z3`` maps binary ``=`` natively). An
    object-language ``=`` inside a modal formula is translated to that SAME binary
    identity (rigid, no world argument — see the module docstring), so the two share
    a symbol and differ in what they relate: this axiom's operands are
    ``World``-guarded worlds, a user equality's are objects, and ``World`` / ``Object``
    are disjoint, so neither equates operands of the other kind.

    Emitted only when ``T`` and ``N`` BOTH occur and ``temporal_closure`` is on, mirroring
    ``isabelle_modal``'s ``t_in_nstar`` (which pins ``t = rtranclp n`` outright, HOL being
    able to say what first-order logic cannot) and for the same reason: the axiom relates
    the two relations, so it is vacuous — and misleading — unless both are in play.

    and load-bearing: the axiom constrains only the relations, every *use* site is already
    ``World``-guarded by ``_box`` / ``_diamond`` / ``_box_agent``, and a guarded version
    would silently fail to fire for a FREE agent variable, since nothing types a free
    variable as an ``Object`` — so ``∀x (K_x φ → B_x φ)`` would come out invalid.
    Soundness is untouched: any oracle model in which the inclusion holds between world
    pairs expands to a first-order model of the unguarded axiom.

    ``ought_implies_can`` is the ∃-quantified MEET condition ``∀w (World(w) → ∃v (World(v)

    ideal and alethically possible — which is the exact correspondent of ``Oφ → ◇φ`` and
    the same condition the HOL routes emit as ``d_meets_r``. Two details:

    * Unlike the inclusions this one **must** be ``World``-guarded. Unguarded it would
      demand a ``D``-successor for every element of the universe, including objects; with
      the ``D`` typing axiom that forces every object to be a world, contradicting the
      sort-disjointness axiom — an inconsistent hypothesis, under which *everything*
      comes out valid. The guard costs nothing, since ``_box`` / ``_diamond`` only ever
      instantiate the axiom at worlds.
    * It does **not** validate the ``D ⊆ R`` artefacts ``□φ → Oφ`` and ``Pφ → ◇φ``, and
      that is a measured difference rather than a stylistic one. The frame
      ``W = {0,1,2}``, ``D = {(0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(2,2)}``, ``R = {(0,1),(1,1),(2,2)}``

    The conjunction of these is the hypothesis under which a translated formula's

    ``mode`` selects the domain regime (see the module docstring for the existence-axiom
    correspondence). ``systems`` optionally sets the frame system for the AGENT-INDEXED
    epistemic / doxastic relations, e.g. ``systems={"epistemic": "S5", "doxastic": "KD45"}``
    — so knowledge can be made factive (T/S4/S5) and belief consistent (KD45), symmetric
    to the THF exporter.

    The temporal (``T`` reflexive + transitive, ``N ⊆ T``) and deontic (``D`` serial)
    conditions are **on by default**, which is what brings this route into agreement with
    ``satisfies_modal`` and with the Isabelle / THF exporters; see the module docstring
    for the resulting validities and for the transitive-closure limit that keeps temporal
    induction out of reach.

    ``formula`` gates the output: only the relations occurring in it are typed and
    constrained (see :func:`_relations_used` for why that matters — it is a real
    performance and *verdict* concern, not tidiness). Called **without** a formula this
    stays the "give me the whole background theory" call and emits axioms for every
    relation in :data:`QML_RELATIONS`. The same ``formula`` gates the many-sorted
    facts: per sort it uses, that the sort is non-empty at every world, and per sorted
    constant ``c:S``, that ``c`` is in ``S`` at every world (give the formula AS WRITTEN,
    not :func:`qml_translate`'s relativised form, which has forgotten the annotations).

    ``bridges`` is an opt-in list of cross-family frame conditions from
    :data:`QML_BRIDGES`; an unknown name raises ``ValueError`` listing the known ones, and
    so does a bridge whose partner family the ``formula`` never mentions (see
    :func:`_check_bridge_families` — the same rule the HOL routes apply, so one option
    name means one thing on every route). A requested bridge is never gated away by
    :func:`_relations_used`, but it also does not drag its relations' default frame blocks
    into scope.

    ``temporal_closure=False`` drops ``T``'s reflexivity and transitivity and the
    ``first_step`` axiom, keeping only ``N ⊆ T``, for parity with
    ``isabelle_modal_theory`` / ``to_thf_modal_full``. Be aware
    of what that means on a *decision* route: the answers are then those of a strictly
    weaker temporal logic than the one ``satisfies_modal`` implements (``Gφ → φ`` and
    ``Gφ → Fφ`` become underivable), so a ``False`` under it is not evidence about the
    oracle's temporal logic.

    comes out valid. ``bridges`` opts into the cross-family relation inclusions of
    :data:`QML_BRIDGES` (none by default).

    Sound but bounded-incomplete: ``True`` means Z3 proved validity; ``False`` means it
    did not (a genuine countermodel, or — since first-order modal logic is undecidable
    — an instance Z3 could not close). For a definite countermodel use
    :func:`unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal` over an explicit model.

    Two contract details worth knowing before reading a verdict:

    - a temporal or deontic formula is judged under the default-on frame conditions, so
      ``True`` for a deontic formula means "valid over every SERIAL-deontic model", and
      temporal induction ``(φ ∧ G(φ → Xφ)) → Gφ`` comes back ``False`` here despite
      holding in every intended model — decide that one with
      :func:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.isabelle_runner.isabelle_decide_modal`;
    - an identity atom ``=`` / ``≠`` is rigid (no world argument) and existence-
      independent under every ``mode``; see the module docstring's "Equality is rigid"
      for the varying-domain choice and for why ``□(a = b) → a = b`` needs a frame
      with a successor-or-self (T, S4, S5, KD …) while ``a = b → □(a = b)`` holds in K;
    - a variable that is free in ``formula`` is a PARAMETER: one unknown individual, the
      same everywhere in the formula. Under ``mode='constant'`` / ``'possibilist'`` it is an
      element of the object domain, so ``∀x P(x) → P(y)`` and ``P(y) → ∃x P(x)`` are valid;
      under a varying regime it exists at the world of evaluation (and need not exist at any
      other), so those two are valid there too while ``□∀x P(x) → □P(y)`` is valid under
      ``'constant'`` / ``'possibilist'`` / ``'increasing'`` only. A constant is not read
      that way (it may lie outside the world's domain); see the module docstring's "A free
      variable is a parameter";
    - a deontic ``False`` is typically Z3 returning *unknown* rather than a countermodel:
      the ∃-quantified seriality axiom defeats its model finder, measured identical at
      1 s / 2 s / 10 s budgets (the same behaviour ``frame="KD"`` has always had). A short
      ``timeout`` therefore costs no reliability on deontic non-theorems.

    Produces a complete, self-contained THF problem — type declarations, the lifted
    modal operators, the frame axioms for ``frame`` (K/T/S4/S5/KD/KD45), the
    ``existsAt`` domain axioms for ``mode`` (constant / increasing / decreasing /
    varying), and the conjecture ``mvalid @ ⟨formula⟩`` — ready for a higher-order
    ATP (Leo-III, Satallax). Covers the alethic □/◇ fragment.

    Equality ``=`` / ``≠`` is **rigid identity**, the reading of :func:`qml_is_valid` /
    :func:`qml_translate` (module docstring, "Equality is rigid"): THF's own ``=`` over
    the individual sort ``$i`` with no world argument, through one extra macro
    ``meq = ^ [A: $i, B: $i, W: mu] : ( A = B )`` that is emitted only when the formula
    contains identity (so an equality-free problem is unchanged). ``t₁ ≠ t₂`` is lowered
    to ``¬(t₁ = t₂)`` as ``qml_translate`` does, a non-binary ``=`` / ``≠`` atom raises
    ``ValueError`` as there, and no ``feq`` / ``fneq`` functor is declared. So a prover
    on this problem answers the question :func:`qml_is_valid` answers: ``∀x (x = x)``,
    ``a = b → □(a = b)`` and ``◇(a = b) → a = b`` are theorems under ``frame='K'``,
    ``□(a = b) → a = b`` only under a reflexive / serial frame. Identity is not
    existence-guarded (the module docstring's varying-domain choice). The macro and the
    lowering live in :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.hol.thf_modal`, which emits the same line.

    THF has no free variable, so a variable that is free in ``formula`` (a parameter, see
    the module docstring's "A free variable is a parameter") is bound in the conjecture:
    ``! [Y: $i] : mvalid @ …``, and under a varying regime ``existsAt @ Y`` guards the
    formula (``! [Y: $i] : mvalid @ (mimplies @ (existsAt @ Y) @ …)``), which is the
    reading :func:`qml_is_valid` has. For a single formula with no premise this binding
    is the parameter reading itself.
