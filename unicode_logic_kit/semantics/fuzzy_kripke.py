"""Graded (fuzzy) Kripke semantics: a truth-DEGREE evaluator for modal logic over a
t-norm, generalising :mod:`kripke`'s two-valued satisfaction relation the way
:mod:`fuzzy` generalises classical FOL.

A :class:`FuzzyKripkeModel` is the graded analogue of
:class:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.KripkeModel`: instead of a crisp
edge SET, each named accessibility relation is a ``Dict[(w, w'), float]`` of
edge WEIGHTS in ``[0, 1]`` (a missing pair reads as ``0.0``); instead of a
crisp atom-key SET, each world's valuation is a ``Dict[str, float]`` of
ground-atom DEGREES in ``[0, 1]`` (a missing key reads as ``0.0``). This is
exactly the "fuzzify every crisp component of the frame" move of Fitting's
many-valued modal logics (M. Fitting, "Many-valued modal logics",
*Fundamenta Informaticae* 15(3-4), 1991, 235-254, and its sequel "Many-valued
modal logics II", *Fundamenta Informaticae* 17(1-2), 1992, 55-73) and of the
residuated Kripke frames studied by Hájek (P. Hájek, *Metamathematics of
Fuzzy Logic*, Kluwer, 1998, ch. 8) and, for the specific residuated □ /
t-norm ◇ pair implemented here, by Bou, Esteva, Godo & Rodríguez ("On the
minimum many-valued modal logic over a finite residuated lattice", *Journal
of Logic and Computation* 21(5), 2011, 739-790).

:func:`satisfies_fuzzy_modal` returns a truth DEGREE in ``[0, 1]`` (mirroring
:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.fuzzy.evaluate`'s float-returning shape,
not :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal`'s bool one):

- an ``Atom`` looks up its degree in the current world's valuation;
- the Łukasiewicz connectives (``LukNegation`` / ``WeakConjunction`` /
  ``WeakDisjunction`` / ``StrongConjunction`` / ``StrongDisjunction`` /
  ``LukImplication`` / ``LukEquivalence``) dispatch straight to
  ``model.tnorm``'s ``neg`` / weak min-max / ``conj`` / ``disj`` / ``impl`` /
  ``equiv`` — verbatim reuse of :mod:`tnorm`, no new connective semantics;
- ``Box φ`` is the RESIDUATED universal reading
  ``inf_{w'} tnorm.impl(R(w, w'), deg(φ, w'))`` — "every accessible world
  forces φ AT LEAST as much as it is accessible" — and ``Diamond φ`` is the
  T-NORM existential reading ``sup_{w'} tnorm.conj(R(w, w'), deg(φ, w'))`` —
  "some accessible world witnesses φ, discounted by how accessible it is".
  The aggregation domain at ``world`` is ``model.worlds`` UNIONED with every
  actual edge target ``w'`` for which ``(world, w') `` has a positive weight
  in the named relation — this matches
  :meth:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.KripkeModel.successors` exactly,
  which is never filtered by ``model.worlds`` either (a relation may name an
  edge to a world outside the declared ``worlds=`` set, and that edge must
  still be counted, not silently dropped). Because ``tnorm.impl(0, y) = 1``
  and ``tnorm.conj(0, y) = 0`` for all three t-norms in :mod:`tnorm` (0 is
  the residuum's right-identity and the t-norm's absorbing element), the
  ``model.worlds`` members that carry no edge to them contribute only the
  aggregate's neutral element, so folding them into the domain alongside the
  true successors is always safe. An empty aggregation domain (no worlds
  declared AND no successor edge from ``world`` in this relation) is the one
  place the aggregate set is genuinely empty; it is handled by the same
  convention :mod:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke` uses for a vacuous
  crisp Box/Diamond: infimum over the empty set is ``1.0``, supremum is
  ``0.0``.
  ``Knows`` / ``Believes`` / ``Says`` / ``Wants`` get the same residuated
  UNIVERSAL reading as ``Box`` (matching
  :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal`, where all four
  are ``all(...)``-quantified exactly like Box) over their own
  ``"K:"``/``"B:"``/``"Say:"``/``"Want:"``-prefixed relation, for free, via
  the same relation-name mechanism :mod:`kripke` documents.
- ``∀x φ`` / ``∃x φ`` are the infimum / supremum of ``φ`` over the model's
  ``domain``, and ``∀x:S φ`` / ``∃x:S φ`` over ``sort_universes[S]``, exactly as
  :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.fuzzy.evaluate` reads them: an individual
  is named by a constant, and the bound variable is replaced by each name in
  turn. The domain is ONE set for every world (constant domains, the setting
  of Hájek's fuzzy modal predicate logics); a model has no per-world domain.
- ``∀P φ`` / ``∃P φ`` (``SecondOrderQuantifier``) are the infimum / supremum of
  ``φ`` over every FUZZY interpretation of the bound predicate. A bound
  predicate is an intension, as in :mod:`kripke`: it has a degree of its own
  at each world for each of its ground atoms, so the quantifier ranges over
  every assignment of a degree in ``[0, 1]`` to each of them. That is an
  optimisation over a real cube, not an enumeration, and it is computed exactly
  as linear real arithmetic by
  :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.atp.z3_fuzzy_kripke.predicate_quantifier_degree`
  (Łukasiewicz and Gödel; the product t-norm is not linear and is refused by
  name). ``∀P (P ∨ ¬P)`` has degree ``1/2`` under Łukasiewicz: the infimum of
  ``max(p, 1 − p)`` is reached at ``p = 1/2``.
- A third-order atom (``Pos(G)``, a predicate in argument position) is a letter
  of its own, looked up by its written form like any other atom: the property
  is taken by NAME. So ``Pos(G)`` and ``Pos(H)`` are two letters even where
  ``G`` and ``H`` have the same degrees everywhere, and a predicate quantifier
  that binds a predicate standing in argument position is refused by name.

**Scope.** The modal operators read are ``Box`` / ``Diamond`` / ``Knows`` /
``Believes`` / ``Says`` / ``Wants``, each by one step of aggregation. Every
other node kind :mod:`kripke` interprets is refused by name, not approximated:

- classical crisp connectives (``Not``/``And``/``Or``/``Implies``/``Iff``/
  ``Xor``) — a formula meant for graded evaluation must be built with fuzzy
  connective nodes, the same discipline :mod:`fuzzy` already enforces for
  non-modal formulas;
- the lambda-calculus nodes in formula position, via :mod:`_modal_reject`'s
  shared ``reject_lambda``;
- temporal closure (``Next``/``Always``/``Eventually``/``Until``/
  ``Previous``/``Historically``/``Once``/``Since``), hybrid logic
  (``Nominal``/``At``), public announcement logic (``Announce``/
  ``AnnounceDiamond``), group-epistemic operators (``EverybodyKnows``/
  ``DistributedKnowledge``/``CommonKnowledge``), and Standard-Deontic-style
  serial-frame reasoning (``Obligatory``/``Permitted``) — a graded fixpoint,
  model update, or group-relation combinator over a CONTINUOUS t-norm is an
  open research question in its own right (what does "the least fixpoint of
  a residuated implication" even mean over ``[0, 1]``? how does public
  announcement restrict a model whose edges are weights, not a crisp
  subset?) and must not be silently approximated by, say, reusing the crisp
  fixpoint machinery over a 0/1-thresholded relation.

The formulas come from ``MSFLParser(fuzzy=True, modal=True)`` (with
``many_sorted``, ``second_order`` or ``third_order`` as wanted), or from the Node
API directly (``Box(WeakConjunction(Atom("P", []), Atom("Q", [])))``). The parser
reads the whole modal family; the operators outside the scope above parse and
are refused here. A search for a countermodel is
:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.atp.z3_fuzzy_kripke.fuzzy_modal_search`.

    Args:
        worlds: an iterable of worlds (any hashable values). Stored as a
            frozen set; duplicates collapse.
        relations: maps a relation NAME (str) to a ``Dict[(w, w'), float]`` of
            edge weights in ``[0, 1]`` — the graded generalisation of
            :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.KripkeModel`'s crisp
            edge SETS. Recognised names follow the same convention:
            ``"alethic"`` (Box/Diamond), ``"K:"+agent`` (Knows),
            ``"B:"+agent`` (Believes), ``"Say:"+agent`` (Says),
            ``"Want:"+agent`` (Wants). A missing name is the everywhere-zero
            relation; within a named relation, a missing ``(w, w')`` pair
            reads as weight ``0.0``. Each weight is clamped into ``[0, 1]``.
        valuation: maps a world to a ``Dict[str, float]`` of GROUND-ATOM-KEY
            (the text of the atom with every constant written by its name, ``P(a)``
            for the atom ``P`` of the constant ``a``, and a sorted constant ``c:S``
            read as the constant ``c``, the same convention as
            :mod:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.fuzzy`'s valuation and
            :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.KripkeModel`'s atom
            keys; the text of the atom as a formula, ``P('a')``, is read as
            the same key) to a degree in ``[0, 1]``. A missing world, or a
            missing key within a world, reads as degree ``0.0``. A world that
            holds both spellings of one atom with different degrees is refused
            when the atom is read (``ValueError``). Each degree is
            clamped into ``[0, 1]``.
        tnorm: a :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.tnorm.TNorm` instance
            (one of :data:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.tnorm.LUKASIEWICZ`,
            :data:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.tnorm.GODEL`,

            one) fixing the strong connectives AND the Box/Diamond residuum —
            reused UNMODIFIED from :mod:`tnorm`, never re-implemented here.
            Defaults to :data:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.tnorm.LUKASIEWICZ`.
        domain: the constant names an unsorted quantifier ``∀x`` / ``∃x`` ranges
            over, the same set at every world. ``None`` (the default) for a model
            of formulas without one; a quantifier then raises ``ValueError``.
        sort_universes: maps a sort name to the constant names ``∀x:S`` / ``∃x:S``
            range over, the same set at every world.

    All mappings default to empty, so ``FuzzyKripkeModel({0, 1})`` is a valid
    (atom-free, relation-free, everywhere-0.0) frame. The constructor copies
    every container into an immutable view, so later edits to the caller's

    """Compute the truth DEGREE in ``[0, 1]`` of ``formula`` at ``world`` in ``model``.

    Args:
        formula: a modal formula over the Łukasiewicz connective nodes (never
            classical And/Or/Not/Implies/Iff/Xor), from
            ``MSFLParser(fuzzy=True, modal=True)`` or built from the Node API:
            Box/Diamond/Knows/Believes/Says/Wants, individual quantifiers,
            predicate quantifiers, and atoms (a third-order atom is a letter of
            its own, see the module docstring).
        model: the :class:`FuzzyKripkeModel` to evaluate against.
        world: the world to evaluate at (any hashable value; need not be a
            member of ``model.worlds``, exactly like
            :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.kripke.satisfies_modal`).

    Returns:
        The truth degree as a float clamped to ``[0, 1]``.

        NotImplementedError: on a lambda node in formula position, a
            temporal/hybrid/PAL/group-epistemic/deontic node (see the module
            docstring), a predicate quantifier under a t-norm that is not
            Łukasiewicz or Gödel, a predicate quantifier whose bound predicate
            stands in argument position, or an otherwise unsupported node type.
        TypeError: on a classical crisp connective (build the formula with
            fuzzy connective nodes instead).
        ValueError: the valuation of a world holds both spellings of an atom (its key and
            its text as a formula) with different degrees; a quantifier is reached and
            the model has no ``domain`` (no ``sort_universes`` entry for its sort), or

            ``model.sort_universes[S]`` does not hold.
