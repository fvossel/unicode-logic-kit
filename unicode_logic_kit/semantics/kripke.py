"""Kripke (possible-worlds) semantics for the propositional modal fragment.

A :class:`KripkeModel` is a possible-worlds frame: a set of worlds, a family of
named accessibility relations between worlds, and a per-world valuation of the
ground atoms. :func:`satisfies_modal` computes the truth value of a modal
formula *at a world*, following the standard Kripke satisfaction relation.

Only the **propositional / ground** modal fragment is interpreted here (this is
v1): the modal operators wrap classical connectives and ground atoms. A ground
atom is identified by its key (:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.fol.atom_key`: the text it prints as,
with every constant written by its name, e.g. ``"P"`` or ``"Likes(a, b)"``, also where the
formula text writes the constant in quotes, ``Likes('a', 'b')``); a world's valuation
is the set of atom keys true there, and an atom whose key is written either way (its key or
its text as a formula, ``atom.to_unicode_str()``) is found, so a missing key is false.
Object quantifiers
(plain ``Quantifier`` and sorted ``SortedQuantifier``, see "Many-sorted formulas"
below) ARE interpreted, over per-world domains; Łukasiewicz operators and lambda nodes are rejected
with NotImplementedError — fuzzy modal logic is future work.

Many-sorted formulas: ``satisfies_modal`` relativizes the WHOLE input formula
ONCE, up front, before any dispatch — the same "relativize once, up front"
choice ``fol.qml.qml_translate`` / ``semantics.intuitionistic._prepare_many_sorted``
make and for the identical reason: a ``SortedConstant`` (``alice:Human``) can
occur anywhere in the formula, not only directly under a ``SortedQuantifier``,
so relativizing lazily (only when the recursive descent happens to walk into a
``SortedQuantifier`` node) would leave a bare sorted constant's ``:Sort``
suffix in place, and the valuation lookup for it would then silently miss.
Relativizing uses ``Node._relativize`` (the same reduction ``fol.to_fol``
uses): a ``SortedQuantifier`` (``∀x:S φ`` / ``∃x:S φ``) becomes a guarded plain
``Quantifier`` — ``∀x (S(x) → φ)`` / ``∃x (S(x) ∧ φ)`` — over the current
world's domain ``D_w``; a bare ``SortedConstant`` becomes a plain ``Constant``.
Two consequences of this reduction, both deliberate design choices, not gaps:

- **Sorts are world-relative, not rigid.** The sort guard ``S(x)`` is an
  ordinary atom, looked up in ``valuation`` exactly like any other atom, so an
  individual can be ``S`` at one world and not at another — the same
  "actualist" reading this module already gives the bare per-world domain
  ``D_w`` (see ``domains``/``domain_at`` above). A caller that wants a sort
  RIGID (the same extension at every world) states that itself, as an extra
  frame condition on the relation being evaluated over (e.g. asserting
  ``S(d) ↔ S'(d)`` between every pair of accessible worlds in the model it
  builds) — this evaluator does not assume or enforce it.
- **Non-emptiness is the caller's responsibility, exactly as it already is for
  the unsorted domain.** This evaluator never assumes a sort — or a bare
  per-world domain — is non-empty; ``∀x:S φ → ∃x:S φ`` can come out FALSE
  here if the model happens to make ``S`` empty at ``world``. The classical
  many-sorted routes (``api.prove`` et al.) instead ALWAYS assume every sort
  is non-empty, by adding ``fol.nonempty_sort_axioms`` as extra premises (see
  that function's docstring) — so a caller who wants THIS evaluator to agree
  with a classical MSFOL verdict on a modal-free sorted formula must build the
  ``KripkeModel`` so each mentioned sort's guard atom holds of at least one
  individual in ``D_w`` at every world that matters, the same way domains and
  valuations are already the caller's construction to get right. See
  ``tests/test_sorted_modal.py`` for a worked differential against
  ``api.prove`` built this way.
- **A sorted constant being in its sort is a property of the MODEL, too.**
  ``c:S`` denotes an element of ``S``, and a constant is a rigid designator, so
  in a legal model the guard atom ``S(c)`` is true at EVERY world — whatever the
  world's domain says about whether ``c`` exists there. The evaluator reads the
  guard from the valuation like any other atom and does not check it: in a model
  that leaves ``Human(socrates)`` out of some world's valuation,
  ``∀x:Human Mortal(x) → Mortal(socrates:Human)`` can be FALSE there, a model
  the many-sorted routes (``qml_is_valid``, ``api.prove``) never consider. The
  routes assert the fact as a background axiom (``fol.sort_membership_axioms``,
  lifted per world by ``fol.qml``) and an evaluator of ONE given model cannot, so
  a caller who compares this evaluator with them builds the model that way, or
  asks :func:`sorted_constant_violations` which worlds of a model fall short. A
  plain constant ``socrates`` has no sort, and nothing is asserted about it.

Equality is NOT interpreted. ``=`` and ``≠`` need a semantics of TERMS — what
``a`` and ``b`` denote, so that ``a = b`` can be decided as identity of those
denotations — and this evaluator has none: it never interprets a term, it looks
an atom up by its rendered key in a world's valuation set. Run on ``a = b`` that
lookup would silently read the identity as an uninterpreted proposition keyed
``"a = b"``, so ``a = a`` would come out FALSE unless a caller happened to
list it, and ``□(a = b) → a = b`` would be decided by the frame alone. The kit's
rule is that an unsupported fragment is refused loudly, never approximated, so
:func:`satisfies_modal` (and so :func:`ctl_ex` / :func:`ctl_af` / :func:`ctl_eg`
/ :func:`ctl_au`, and every evaluator built on it) raises ``NotImplementedError``
naming the atom as soon as ANY ``=`` / ``≠`` atom occurs ANYWHERE in the formula
— the check scans the whole tree before evaluating, because evaluating lazily
would let a short-circuit (``P ∨ a = b`` at a world where ``P`` holds), a
vacuous ``□`` at a dead end, or an empty domain skip the atom and return a verdict
that never looked at it. Decide identity with :func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.qml.qml_is_valid`
(quantified modal logic, where ``=`` is rigid identity over the object domain) or
a first-order route; the other arithmetic comparisons (``<``, ``≤`` …) are
ordinary keyed atoms here, exactly as before.

Second-order quantifiers (``SecondOrderQuantifier``, ``∀P φ`` / ``∃P φ``) are
interpreted. A bound predicate is an INTENSION: it has an extension of its own at
each world, so ``∀P`` ranges over every way of making each ground atom headed by
``P`` true or false at each world. For a propositional ``P`` that is every set of
worlds, and the frame conditions of correspondence theory become formulas of the
object language: ``∀P (□P → P)`` is true at ``w`` exactly when ``w`` sees itself,
and ``∀P (□P → □□P)`` exactly when every world two steps from ``w`` is one step
from it. For a ``P`` with arguments the ground atoms are the instances of its
applications in the body. An argument bound by an object quantifier inside the
body ranges over the individuals of EVERY world's domain: a predicate quantifier
is not restricted to what exists at one world (``hol.ho_modal`` types a property
``i ⇒ σ`` in every domain regime, for the same reason). Any other argument is the
term as written.

The evaluation is the one ``Down`` uses below: the quantifier is decided by
evaluating its body in the models that differ from the given one in the valuation
of those atoms. So an inner binder of the same name shadows the outer one, and
every operator of this module, announcements and group knowledge included, reads
a bound predicate like any other atom. One quantifier costs
``2 ** (worlds * instances)`` evaluations of its body, and
:data:`MAX_PREDICATE_INTERPRETATIONS` refuses a larger one.

Two limits come from a term being its own name here (see "Equality is NOT
interpreted" above):

- Two different ground terms are two individuals. ``∃P (P(a) ∧ ¬P(b))`` is
  therefore true in every model of this module, although a model in which ``a``
  and ``b`` name one individual falsifies it. An evaluation of ONE given model is
  not affected; a search over models is, and
  :func:`~unicode_logic_kit.atp.kripke_enum.modal_enum_search` refuses a formula
  in which bound predicates are applied to two different terms.
- A predicate in ARGUMENT position (third order, ``Pos(P)``) is part of the
  written form of an atom and nothing more. Under a quantifier that binds it the
  atom would not follow the quantifier, so it is refused by name.

Relation-name convention (keys of :attr:`KripkeModel.relations`):

- ``"alethic"``        — the accessibility relation for Box □ / Diamond ◇.
- ``"K:" + agent``     — the epistemic relation for ``Knows(agent, …)``, and
                         also what ``EverybodyKnows``/``DistributedKnowledge``/
                         ``CommonKnowledge`` (group operators E_G/D_G/C_G, see
                         below) combine by union/intersection/reflexive-
                         transitive-closure — there is no separate relation
                         family for the group operators.
- ``"B:" + agent``     — the doxastic relation for ``Believes(agent, …)``.
- ``"Say:" + agent``   — the assertive relation for ``Says(agent, …)`` (non-factive).
- ``"Want:" + agent``  — the bouletic relation for ``Wants(agent, …)`` (non-veridical).
- ``"temporal"``       — the one-step successor relation for Next / Always /
                         Eventually / Until.
- ``"deontic"``        — the (serial) accessibility relation for Obligatory O /
                         Permitted P (Standard Deontic Logic, the system KD).

A missing relation denotes the empty relation; a missing world valuation denotes
the empty set (every atom false there). Inputs are never mutated: the closure
and path helpers build fresh sets.

Hybrid logic H(@) is interpreted through the optional ``nominals`` mapping
(name → world): ``Nominal(i)`` is true exactly at the world the assignment
names, and ``At(i, φ)`` evaluates φ *at* that world, wherever the evaluation
currently stands. A nominal without an assignment raises a ValueError naming
it (rather than silently defaulting), since a nominal must name exactly one
world for the hybrid semantics to make sense.

The ↓ binder (N1, full H(@,↓)) — ``Down(x, φ)`` (``↓x.φ``) — is interpreted
the same way, with no extra machinery: evaluating ``Down(x, φ)`` at world
``w`` locally REBINDS the nominal named ``x`` to ``w`` for the evaluation of
``φ`` (still at ``w``), by recursing with a model whose ``nominals`` mapping
is ``model.nominals`` overridden at key ``x``. Because that override is a
plain dict-key overwrite — not a textual rewrite of ``φ`` — the usual
name-scoping rules of a binder fall out automatically, with no separate
alpha-renaming/fresh-name step: a nested ``Down(x, …)`` inside ``φ`` overrides
the SAME key again for its own (deeper) scope, so it shadows the outer
binding exactly the way a nested ``∀x`` would (``↓x.↓x.φ`` behaves as bare
``φ``, the outer binding entirely inert); a DIFFERENTLY-named nested binder
``Down(y, …)`` with ``y ≠ x`` extends the dict at a different key and leaves
``x`` untouched, so it cannot capture an outer ``@x``/bare-``x`` occurrence
(``↓x.(P ∧ ↓y.@x Q)`` — the inner ``↓y`` cannot affect the outer ``@x``); and
because the rebound world ``w`` is fixed in the dict rather than tracked
positionally, an occurrence of ``x`` reached through a LATER modality (a
``Box``/``Diamond`` inside ``φ`` moving evaluation to some other world
``w2``) still resolves to the ORIGINAL ``w`` — the state variable, once
bound, is rigid for the rest of its scope, exactly like a nominal already is
(this is what makes ``↓x.□¬x`` the FO irreflexivity condition: for every
successor ``w2`` of ``w``, ``¬x`` means "``w2`` is not the world ``x``
names", i.e. not ``w`` itself).

H(@,↓) validity is UNDECIDABLE, but evaluation at a GIVEN finite model is not
touched by that — ``satisfies_modal`` decides ``Down`` exactly as it decides
every other construct here, so it remains the terminating, always-available
"route A" oracle for ↓ (hand-built models, and the brute-force battery in
``tests/test_hybrid_down.py``), and the oracle
:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.atp.kripke_enum.modal_enum_search`'s bounded search
re-verifies every countermodel it reports against. See
:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.fol._hybrid_nodes` (the ``Down`` node) and
:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.modal_translation` (``down_is_valid``, the
Z3/PROVED-only "route B" half) for the rest of the architecture.

Group epistemic operators — ``EverybodyKnows`` (E_G φ), ``DistributedKnowledge``
(D_G φ), and ``CommonKnowledge`` (C_G φ), each carrying a ``group`` tuple of
agent terms (:mod:`unicode_logic_kit.fol._modal_nodes`, parsed from
``E_{a,b,…}``/``D_{a,b,…}``/``C_{a,b,…}`` surface syntax) — are THIN dispatches
into :mod:`unicode_logic_kit.semantics.action_models`'s
:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.action_models.everybody_knows` /
:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.action_models.distributed_knowledge_holds` /
:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.action_models.common_knowledge_holds`, which
implement the actual union/intersection/closure semantics over the group's
``"K:"+agent`` relations — this module owns none of that logic, only the
node-to-function wiring (see those functions' docstrings for the semantics,
including ``distributed_knowledge_holds``'s deliberately-different empty-group
convention: it RAISES rather than defaulting).

Public announcement logic (PAL) is interpreted directly — ``Announce`` (``[φ!]ψ``)
and ``AnnounceDiamond`` (``⟨φ!⟩ψ``) are the only two constructs here that do NOT
just recurse at a fixed world or along a fixed relation: they build the
φ-restricted model ``M|φ`` (:func:`unicode_logic_kit.semantics.dynamic_epistemic.announce`)
and evaluate ``ψ`` there. This is the ORACLE that
:func:`unicode_logic_kit.fol.pal.reduce_announcements` (a purely SYNTACTIC
elimination of Announce/AnnounceDiamond, sound only for the propositional-modal
fragment interpreted here) is differentially tested against.

Documented temporal semantics:

- ``Next φ``: φ holds at **all** immediate ``"temporal"``-successors of the
  current world. On a deterministic / linear frame (each world has at most one
  successor) this is exactly "φ at the unique next state"; on a branching frame
  it is read universally (the "for all next states" reading).
- ``Always φ`` (G): φ holds at every world reachable from the current world via
  the **reflexive-transitive** closure of ``"temporal"`` (the current world
  included).
- ``Eventually φ`` (F): φ holds at **some** such reachable world (current world
  included).
- ``Until(φ, ψ)``: there is a finite ``"temporal"`` path
  ``w0 → w1 → … → wn`` (n ≥ 0) starting at the current world with ψ true at
  ``wn`` and φ true at every earlier world ``w0 … w(n-1)``. This is the
  finite-reachability reading of strong Until; the search is depth-first with a
  visited guard so cycles in the frame terminate.

Next / Always / Eventually / Until above are all LINEAR-time: each has exactly
one path reading baked into its single AST node (no A/E path-quantifier prefix
exists anywhere in the AST). Branching-time CTL model checking —
:func:`ctl_ex`, :func:`ctl_af`, :func:`ctl_eg`, :func:`ctl_au` — adds the four
readings that baked-in choice leaves out (EX, the existential dual of Next's
universal reading; AF/EG, the forward/backward fixpoint pair that reachability
alone cannot compute; AU, the universal-path generalisation of Until) as plain
functions taking arbitrary :class:`~unicode_logic_kit.fol.nodes.Node`
subformulas, evaluated via :func:`satisfies_modal` — exactly the pattern
:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.action_models.common_knowledge_holds` and
:func:`~unicode_logic_kit.semantics.action_models.everybody_knows` already use,
not new dispatch branches on ``formula``'s type. See the CTL section near the
end of this module for the fixpoint algorithms and the deadlock convention.

        agents' ``K:``/``B:`` relations, ``alethic``, ``temporal``, ``deontic``
        all coexisting); the relation-name label is what keeps them visually
        distinguishable instead of collapsing into indistinguishable arrows.
        Relations and, within each, their edges are emitted in sorted order too,
        so the whole output is deterministic and directly string-comparable.

# - ctl_af/ctl_eg are the missing AF/EG dual pair. Note AF is NOT the same
#   computation as reflexive_transitive_closure: a world can satisfy "phi
#   holds on every path" without phi holding at every REACHABLE world (some
#   paths from it may loop back through phi-free territory before others
#   reach a phi-world), so a genuine forward least-fixpoint is needed, not a

# relation RESTRICTED to model.worlds: their state space IS model.worlds, so
# an edge into a world outside it cannot be a step of the fixpoint — unlike
